<h2>EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">TO</span><br />
<br />
ANNE OF GEIERSTEIN.</h2>

<p>With "The Fair Maid of Perth" we take farewell
of Scott at his best, though "even from the stubble
one may tell what the grain has been." "Anne of
Geierstein" was no favourite of the author's, and, as
Mr. Matthew Arnold says, the world does not contemplate
with pleasure what the poet creates without joy.
The novel was begun in the late summer or autumn of
1828, but for part of the time Scott neglected his Diary.
He was become (June 19) "a writing automaton," and
suffered much pain from rheumatism and rheumatic headaches.
He feared that this affected "the quality of the
stuff," but he was not one who "waited for the spark
from heaven to fall." He plodded on, in these late years,
<i>invita Minerva</i>. Of old the goddess had generally been
willing; but now his task took the likeness of journalism,
the round had to be trodden, be he well or be he
ill. Masterpieces are not written thus: it is the moral
effort that we admire, and the contempt for fame, even
for art, compared with the respect for duty. Scott
believed in his duty and in his power of will, but
imagination will not obey a moral dictate. We find
Ballantyne "complaining of his manuscript": the
wearied hand no longer wrote legibly, despite the
mechanical supports which he used. "I cannot trace
my <i>pieds de mouche</i> but with great labour and trouble"
(June 22). He "wrought and endured," afflicted by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">x</a></span>
hypochondriacal melancholy: "it may be chased away
by study or by exercise." He is nobly master of his
fate, in every event. In July we find him "beginning
Simond's 'Switzerland,'" in search of local colour, for
he did not know Switzerland, nor even the Rhine.
His description of a storm in the mountains is, in the
circumstances, wonderfully accurate. He simply drew
the hills above Loch Skene on a grander scale. Morritt
and Sir James Stuart of Allanbank, who were well
acquainted with the scenes, were "surprised at the
felicity with which he divined its character, and outdid,
by the force of imagination, all the efforts of a thousand
actual tourists." Their praise much encouraged Sir
Walter (Lockhart, ix. 279). Ballantyne "bored and
bothered me with his criticisms," he said, for he did not
pretend to be a geologist, and to describe the formation
of the rocks. In January he "muzzed on"&mdash;I can
call it little better&mdash;with "Anne of Geierstein." The
"materials are excellent, but the power of using them
is failing." In February (1829) he was better "pleased
with his work." The reason why he was better pleased
may perhaps be gathered from his Journal (Feb. 17):
"I called on Skene, and borrowed a volume of his journal
to get some information about Burgundy and
Provence. Something may be made out of King René,
but I wish I had thought of him sooner." This is
elucidated by a note of Mr. Skene's: "Sir Walter
wished to see a paper which I had some time before
contributed to the Memoirs of the Society of Antiquaries
on the subject of the secret tribunals of Germany,
and upon which, accordingly, he grounded his scene in
the novel." Mr. Skene now suggested the introduction
of King René of Provence, as he himself could
give topographical details. "He liked the idea much
... and the whole dénouement of the story was changed,
and the Provence part woven into it, in the form in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XI" id="Page_XI">xi</a></span>
which it ultimately came forth" (Journal, ii. 235,
note). On March 8 "Cadell totally condemns 'Anne
of Geierstein' ... great dishonour in this, as Trinculo
says, besides an infinite loss. Yet worse has succeeded,
but it was while the fashion of the thing was fresh. I
retrenched a good deal about the Troubadours, which
was really <i>hors de place</i>" (April 14). After some weeks
of work and reflection, he came to the conclusion that
more pains would not serve his turn. Inspiration came
at once, if it came at all, and now his "braes and burn-sides"
were ceasing to inspire him. "I don't know why
or wherefore, but I hate 'Anne'" (April 27). "The
story will end, and shall end, because it must end, and
so here goes." He finished "Anne of Geierstein"
on April 29, and began an historical work for Dr. Lardner
on the same day. He had been writing reviews and
other trifles all the time. "Were necessity out of
the question, I would take the same literary labour
from choice&mdash;something more leisurely, though."</p>

<p>The book was published in the middle of May, and
was very popular in Switzerland. Lockhart praises
"occasional outbursts of the old poetic spirit," as in
the Alpine storm, the wild climb of Arthur, the duel,
the noble picture of the battle of Granson. No one
else then writing in England could have matched these
passages. Lockhart especially admired the sympathy
with which an old and weary man "depicts the feelings
of youth with all their original glow and purity."
"He was always living over again in his children,
young at heart whenever he looked on them, and the
world that was opening on them and their friends. But,
above all, he had a firm belief in the future reunion of
those whom death had parted."</p>

<p>The novel is unlucky, perhaps, in the period chosen,
which is not sufficiently familiar to most readers.
The forlorn cause of the House of Lancaster now affects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">xii</a></span>
us very little, and the passion of Margaret of Anjou is
remote&mdash;it cannot stir us like the last view of the
King, in "Redgauntlet." The mechanism of the
volume does suggest the favourite topics of Mrs.
Radcliffe, and the mysterious appearances and disappearances
of the heroine need a more plausible explanation
than they receive. The prophecy turning on the
drawing of the bow is rather dropped out of sight, and
the magic scenes connected with the opal and the mysterious
bride suffer from being explained away. The
miracle is more easy of belief than the explanation.
Though Charles the Bold is painted with power in his
pride and in his fall, he does not interest us like Louis
XI. or James VI., either in this novel or in "Quentin
Durward." It is probable enough that Scott, in his
intended continuation of "Quentin Durward," had this
very period in his eye: perhaps we need not regret
that, with failing powers, he left Quentin out of the
tale. His place is filled by the good dull Sigismund,
who always warms up into a kind of brilliance when
action is to be taken or described. The hero and
heroine do not differ much from Scott's usual characters,
in similar romantic circumstances, but Anne has less
of originality and charm, of course, than the women of
his earlier novels. The story, even on the least favourable
estimate, is a rapid novel of adventure: incident
follows incident, and, as a modern critic says, "the
novel of character is one we often take up, the novel of
incident is one we cannot lay down;" if it be written
with the spirit of Scott, or of Dumas. That friendly
master of romance was just about to take up the pen
which fell from the fingers of Sir Walter&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Uno avulso non deficit alter.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Scott's imitators, in his lifetime, produced little or
nothing of merit: he was, however, to leave successors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">xiii</a></span>
the author of "Vingt Ans Après" first and greatest;
the author of "Esmond"; the author, we may surely
add, of "The Master of Ballantrae." Much as these
differ from Scott, both in quantity and quality of genius,
in method, in style, they are all "sealed of his tribe,"
like the spiritual children of Ben Jonson. Scott is he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Without whose life they had not been,</p>
</div></div>

<p>and thus his example has borne, and still bears, new
fruit in the most innocent of intellectual pleasures.
For a later generation Scott has done what the romances
and the epics did for chivalry, and fairy-tales for all
the world. In an unexpected place, the Memoirs of
Dr. Adam Clarke, we find a tribute to old romance and
fairy-tale. Had he not read these in boyhood, the
learned and excellent Doctor declares, his religion
would have lacked imagination, and his character the
courage which he displayed in face of many dangers.
Examples of lofty fancy, of chivalrous courage, all that
can attract and inspire youth, all that makes against
moody despair, and stolid commonplace, and creeping
prose, Scott gives, even in this late work, and
he enlightens all with humour, as in his admirable
description of the despotic German innkeeper, before
whom the Earl of Oxford has to lower his bonnet. While
youth is youth, and men have yet a smack of it, we can
be happy with Arthur Philipson in his duel, with
Sigismund in the fight, with the cheery maid of Anne
of Geierstein, and her honest ideas of love on first principles,
with that royal philosopher King René, with the
sagacious loyalty of Oxford, and the manly patriotism of
the peasant noble. That the conclusion is entangled,
and the knots rather broken than disengaged, is no
unusual fault in Scott: it haunted his works from the
beginning. Considering his health, his absence, in this
tale, from scenes familiar to him, and times familiar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">xiv</a></span>
his readers, the novel is remarkable for its interest.
What success and merit it possesses are mainly due,
however, to a determined effort of the will, not to
a delighted and conscious inspiration. In his last
essays, though the will was indomitable, the material
machinery of the brain was shattered, and we can
only criticise them as psychological examples of unconquered
courage. He had to see James Ballantyne,
broken by his wife's death, and "squandering his
thoughts and senses upon dowdy metaphysics, and
abstruse theology." It was better for Scott to work
on, and die at his task, at the labour of a life which
would not be complete, would not offer the same invigorating
spectacle, had he thrown his pen away
and confessed himself defeated.</p>

<p>The historical sources of "Anne of Geierstein" are
explained in Scott's own Introduction and Notes. All
the later part of the novel follows the narrative of
Commines closely, save for certain dramatic liberties,
as we shall point out in our additional annotations.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">TO</span><br />
<br />
ANNE OF GEIERSTEIN.</h2>

<p>This novel was written at a time when circumstances
did not place within my reach the stores of a library
tolerably rich in historical works, and especially the
memoirs of the Middle Ages, amidst which I had been
accustomed to pursue the composition of my fictitious
narratives. In other words, it was chiefly the work
of leisure hours in Edinburgh, not of quiet mornings
in the country. In consequence of trusting to a
memory, strongly tenacious certainly, but not less
capricious in its efforts, I have to confess on this
occasion more violations of accuracy in historical details,
than can perhaps be alleged against others of
my novels. In truth, often as I have been complimented
on the strength of my memory, I have through
life been entitled to adopt old Beattie of Meikledale's
answer to his parish minister when eulogising him
with respect to the same faculty. "No, doctor," said
the honest border-laird, "I have no command of my
memory; it only retains what happens to hit my fancy,
and like enough, sir, if you were to preach to me for a
couple of hours on end, I might be unable at the close
of the discourse to remember one word of it." Perhaps
there are few men whose memory serves them
with equal fidelity as to many different classes of subjects;
but I am sorry to say, that while mine has
rarely failed me as to any snatch of verse or trait of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">xvi</a></span>
character that had once interested my fancy, it has
generally been a frail support, not only as to names,
and dates, and other minute technicalities of history,
but as to many more important things.</p>

<p>I hope this apology will suffice for one mistake which
has been pointed out to me by the descendant of one of
the persons introduced in this story, and who complains
with reason that I have made a peasant deputy of the
ancestor of a distinguished and noble family, none of
whom ever declined from the high rank to which, as
far as my pen trenched on it, I now beg leave to restore
them. The name of the person who figures as deputy
of Soleure in these pages, was always, it seems, as it is
now, that of a patrician house. I am reminded by the
same correspondent of another slip, probably of less
consequence. The Emperor of the days my novel
refers to, though the representative of that Leopold
who fell in the great battle of Sempach, never set up
any pretensions against the liberties of the gallant
Swiss, but, on the contrary, treated with uniform
prudence and forbearance such of that nation as had
established their independence, and with wise, as well
as generous kindness, others who still continued to
acknowledge fealty to the imperial crown. Errors
of this sort, however trivial, ought never, in my
opinion, to be pointed out to an author, without meeting
with a candid and respectful acknowledgment.</p>

<p>With regard to a general subject of great curiosity
and interest, in the eyes at least of all antiquarian
students, upon which I have touched at some length
in this narrative, I mean the <i>Vehmic</i> tribunals of Westphalia,
a name so awful in men's ears during many
centuries, and which, through the genius of Goethe,
has again been revived in public fancy with a full
share of its ancient terrors, I am bound to state my
opinion that a wholly new and most important light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVII" id="Page_XVII">xvii</a></span>
has been thrown upon this matter since Anne of Geierstein
first appeared, by the elaborate researches of my
ingenious friend, Mr. Francis Palgrave, whose proof-sheets,
containing the passages I allude to, have been
kindly forwarded to me, and whose complete work will
be before the public ere this Introduction can pass
through the press.</p>

<p>"In Germany," says this very learned writer, "there
existed a singular jurisdiction, which claimed a <i>direct
descent from the Pagan policy and mystic ritual of
the earliest Teutons</i>.</p>

<p>"We learn from the Historians of Saxony, that the
'Frey Feld gericht,' or Free Field Court of Corbey,
was, in Pagan times, under the supremacy of the
Priests of the Eresburgh, the Temple which contained
the Irminsule, or pillar of Irmin. After the conversion
of the people, the possessions of the temple were conferred
by Louis the Pious upon the Abbey which arose
upon its site. The court was composed of sixteen
persons, who held their offices for life. The senior
member presided as the Gerefa or Graff; the junior
performed the humbler duties of 'Frohner,' or summoner;
the remaining fourteen acted as the Echevins,
and by them all judgments were pronounced or declared.
When any one of these died, a new member was
elected by the Priests, from amongst the twenty-two
septs or families inhabiting the Gau or district, and
who included all the hereditary occupants of the soil.
Afterwards, the selection was made by the Monks,
but always with the assent of the Graff and of the
'Frohner.'</p>

<p>"The seat of judgment, the King's seat, or 'Königs-stuhl,'
was always established on the greensward; and
we collect from the context, that the tribunal was also
raised or appointed in the common fields of the Gau,
for the purpose of deciding disputes relating to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVIII" id="Page_XVIII">xviii</a></span>
land within its precinct. Such a 'King's seat' was
a plot sixteen feet in length, and sixteen feet in
breadth; and when the ground was first consecrated,
the Frohner dug a grave in the centre, into which each
of the Free Echevins threw a handful of ashes, a coal,
and a tile. If any doubt arose whether a place of
judgment had been duly hallowed, the Judges sought
for the tokens. If they were not found, then all the
judgments which had been given became null and
void. It was also of the very essence of the Court,
that it should be held beneath the sky, and by the
light of the sun. All the ancient Teutonic judicial
assemblies were held in the open air; but some relics
of solar worship may perhaps be traced in the usage
and in the language of this tribunal. The forms
adopted in the Free Field Court also betray a singular
affinity to the doctrines of the British Bards respecting
their Gorseddau, or Conventions, which were 'always
held in the open air, in the eye of the light, and in
face of the sun.'<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"When a criminal was to be judged, or a cause to
be decided, the Graff and the Free Echevins assembled
around the 'Königs-stuhl;' and the 'Frohner,' having
proclaimed silence, opened the proceedings by reciting
the following rhymes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Sir Graff, with permission,</p>
<p class="i2">I beg you to say,</p>
<p>According to law, and without delay,</p>
<p class="i2">If I, your Knave,</p>
<p class="i2">Who judgment crave,</p>
<p>With your good grace,</p>
<p>Upon the King's seat this seat may place.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"To this address the Graff replied:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIX" id="Page_XIX">xix</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"While the sun shines with even light</p>
<p>Upon Masters and Knaves, I shall declare</p>
<p>The law of might, according to right.</p>
<p>Place the King's seat true and square,</p>
<p>Let even measure, for justice' sake,</p>
<p>Be given in sight of God and man,</p>
<p>That the plaintiff his complaint may make,</p>
<p>And the defendant answer,&mdash;if he can.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"In conformity to this permission, the 'Frohner'
placed the seat of judgment in the middle of the plot,
and then he spake for the second time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Sir Graff, Master brave,</p>
<p>I remind you of your honour, here,</p>
<p>And moreover that I am your Knave;</p>
<p>Tell me, therefore, for law sincere,</p>
<p>If these mete-wands are even and sure,</p>
<p>Fit for the rich and fit for the poor,</p>
<p>Both to measure land and condition;</p>
<p>Tell me as you would eschew perdition.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"And so speaking, he laid the mete-wand on the ground.
The Graff then began to try the measure, by placing
his right foot against the wand, and he was followed
by the other Free Echevins in rank and order, according
to seniority. The length of the mete-wand being
thus proved, the Frohner spake for the third time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Sir Graff, I ask by permission,</p>
<p>If I with your mete-wand may mete</p>
<p>Openly, and without displeasure,</p>
<p>Here the king's free judgment seat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"And the Graff replied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"I permit right,</p>
<p>And I forbid wrong,</p>
<p>Under the pains and penalties</p>
<p>That to the old known laws belong.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Now was the time of measuring the mystic plot;
it was measured by the mete-wand along and athwart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XX" id="Page_XX">xx</a></span>
and when the dimensions were found to be true, the
Graff placed himself in the seat of judgment, and gave
the charge to the assembled Free Echevins, warning
them to pronounce judgment, according to right and
justice.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"On this day, with common consent,</p>
<p>And under the clear firmament,</p>
<p>A free field court is established here,</p>
<p class="i2">In the open eye of day;</p>
<p class="i2">Enter soberly, ye who may.</p>
<p>The seat in its place is pight,</p>
<p>The mete-wand is found to be right;</p>
<p>Declare your judgments without delay:</p>
<p>And let the doom be truly given,</p>
<p>Whilst yet the Sun shines bright in heaven.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Judgment was given by the Free Echevins according
to plurality of voices."</p>

<p>After observing that the author of Anne of Geierstein
had, by what he calls a "very excusable poetical
licence," transferred something of these judicial rhymes
from the Free Field Court of the Abbey of Corbey, to
the Free Vehmic Tribunals of Westphalia, Mr. Palgrave
proceeds to correct many vulgar errors, in which
the novel he remarks on no doubt had shared, with
respect to the actual constitution of those last-named
courts. "The protocols of their proceedings," he
says, "do not altogether realise the popular idea of
their terrors and tyranny." It may be allowed to me
to question whether the mere protocols of such tribunals
are quite enough to annul all the import of
tradition respecting them; but in the following details
there is no doubt much that will instruct the antiquary,
as well as amuse the popular reader.</p>

<p>"The Court," says Mr. Palgrave, "was held with
known and notorious publicity beneath the 'eye of
light;' and the sentences, though speedy and severe,
were founded upon a regular system of established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXI" id="Page_XXI">xxi</a></span>
jurisprudence, not so strange, even to England, as it
may at first sight appear.</p>

<p>"Westphalia, according to its ancient constitution,
was divided into districts called 'Freygraffschafften,'
each of which usually contained one, and sometimes
many, Vehmic tribunals, whose boundaries were accurately
defined. The right of the 'Stuhlherr,' or Lord,
was of a feudal nature, and could be transferred by the
ordinary modes of alienation; and if the Lord did not
choose to act in his own person, he nominated a
'Freigraff' to execute the office in his stead. The
Court itself was composed of 'Freyschöppfen,' Scabini,
or Echevins, nominated by the Graff, and who were
divided into two classes: the ordinary, and the 'Wissenden'
or 'Witan,' who were admitted under a strict
and singular bond of secrecy.</p>

<p>"The initiation of these, the participators in all the
mysteries of the tribunal, could only take place upon
the 'red earth,' or within the limits of the ancient
Duchy of Westphalia. Bareheaded and ungirt, the
candidate is conducted before the dread tribunal. He
is interrogated as to his qualifications, or rather as to
the absence of any disqualification. He must be free
born, a Teuton, and clear of any accusation cognisable
by the tribunal of which he is to become a member.&mdash;If
the answers are satisfactory, he then takes the oath,
swearing by the Holy Law, that he will conceal the
secrets of the Holy Vehme from wife and child&mdash;from
father and mother&mdash;from sister and brother&mdash;from
fire and water&mdash;from every creature upon which the
sun shines, or upon which the rain falls&mdash;from every
being between earth and heaven.</p>

<p>"Another clause relates to his active duties. He
further swears, that he will 'say forth' to the tribunal
all crimes or offences which fall beneath the secret ban
of the Emperor, which he knows to be true, or which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXII" id="Page_XXII">xxii</a></span>
he has heard from trustworthy report; and that he will
not forbear to do so, for love nor for loathing, for gold
nor for silver nor precious stones.&mdash;This oath being
imposed upon him, the new Freischopff was then
intrusted with the secrets of the Vehmic tribunal. He
received the password, by which he was to know his
fellows, and the grip or sign by which they recognised
each other in silence; and he was warned of the
terrible punishment awaiting the perjured brother.&mdash;If
he discloses the secrets of the Court, he is to expect
that he will be suddenly seized by the ministers of
vengeance. His eyes are bound, he is cast down on
the soil, his tongue is torn out through the back of his
neck&mdash;and he is then to be hanged seven times higher
than any other criminal. And whether restrained by
the fear of punishment, or by the stronger ties of
mystery, no instance was ever known of any violation
of the secrets of the tribunal.</p>

<p>"Thus connected by an invisible bond, the members
of the 'Holy Vehme' became extremely numerous. In
the fourteenth century, the league contained upwards
of one hundred thousand members. Persons of every
rank sought to be associated to this powerful community,
and to participate in the immunities which the
brethren possessed. Princes were eager to allow their
ministers to become the members of this mysterious
and holy alliance; and the cities of the Empire were
equally anxious to enrol their magistrates in the
Vehmic union.</p>

<p>"The supreme government of the Vehmic tribunals
was vested in the great or general Chapter, composed
of the Freegraves and all the other initiated members,
high and low. Over this assembly the Emperor might
preside in person, but more usually by his deputy, the
Stadtholder of the ancient Duchy of Westphalia; an
office which, after the fall of Henry the Lion, Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIII" id="Page_XXIII">xxiii</a></span>
of Brunswick, was annexed to the Archbishopric of
Cologne.</p>

<p>"Before the general Chapter, all the members were
liable to account for their acts. And it appears that
the 'Freegraves' reported the proceedings which had
taken place within their jurisdictions in the course of
the year. Unworthy members were expelled, or sustained
a severer punishment. Statutes, or Reformations,
as they were called, were here enacted for the
regulation of the Courts, and the amendment of any
abuses; and new and unforeseen cases, for which the
existing laws did not provide a remedy, received their
determination in the Vehmic Parliament.</p>

<p>"As the Echevins were of two classes, uninitiated
and initiated, so the Vehmic Courts had also a twofold
character; the 'Offenbare Ding' was an Open Court
or Folkmoot; but the 'Heimliche Acht' was the far-famed
Secret Tribunal.</p>

<p>"The first was held three times in each year.
According to the ancient Teutonic usage, it usually
assembled on Tuesday, anciently called 'Dingstag,'
or court-day, as well as 'Diensttag,' or serving-day, the
first open or working day after the two great weekly
festivals of Sun-day and Moon-day. Here all the
householders of the district, whether free or bond,
attended as suitors. The 'Offenbare Ding' exercised
a civil jurisdiction; and in this Folkmoot appeared
any complainant or appellant who sought to obtain the
aid of the Vehmic tribunal, in those cases when it did
not possess that summary jurisdiction from which it
has obtained such fearful celebrity. Here also the
suitors of the district made presentments or 'wroge,'
as they are termed, of any offences committed within
their knowledge, and which were to be punished by
the Graff and Echevins.</p>

<p>"The criminal jurisdiction of the Vehmic Tribunal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIV" id="Page_XXIV">xxiv</a></span>
took the widest range. The 'Vehme' could punish
mere slander and contumely. Any violation of the
Ten Commandments was to be restrained by the
Echevins. Secret crimes, not to be proved by the ordinary
testimony of witnesses, such as magic, witchcraft,
and poison, were particularly to be restrained by
the Vehmic Judges; and they sometimes designated
their jurisdiction as comprehending every offence
against the honour of man or the precepts of religion.
Such a definition, if definition it can be called, evidently
allowed them to bring every action of which an
individual might complain, within the scope of their
tribunals. The forcible usurpation of land became an
offence against the 'Vehme.' And if the property of
an humble individual was occupied by the proud
Burghers of the Hanse, the power of the Defendants
might afford a reasonable excuse for the interference
of the Vehmic power.</p>

<p>"The Echevins, as Conservators of the Ban of the
Empire, were bound to make constant circuits within
their districts, by night and by day. If they could
apprehend a thief, a murderer, or the perpetrator of
any other heinous crime in possession of the 'mainour,'
or in the very act&mdash;or if his own mouth confessed the
deed, they hung him upon the next tree. But to render
this execution legal, the following requisites were
necessary: fresh suit, or the apprehension and execution
of the offender before daybreak or nightfall;&mdash;the
visible evidence of the crime;&mdash;and lastly, that three
Echevins, at least, should seize the offender, testify
against him, and judge of the recent deed.</p>

<p>"If, without any certain accuser, and without the
indication of crime, an individual was strongly and
vehemently suspected; or when the nature of the
offence was such as that its proof could only rest upon
opinion and presumption, the offender then became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXV" id="Page_XXV">xxv</a></span>
subject to what the German jurists term the inquisitorial
proceeding; it became the duty of the Echevin
to denounce the 'Leumund,' or manifest evil fame, to
the secret tribunal. If the Echevins and the Freygraff
were satisfied with the presentment, either from their
own knowledge, or from the information of their compeer,
the offender was said to be 'verfämbt;'&mdash;his
life was forfeited; and wherever he was found by the
brethren of the tribunal, they executed him without
the slightest delay or mercy. An offender who had
escaped from the Echevins was liable to the same
punishment; and such also was the doom of the party
who, after having been summoned pursuant to an
appeal preferred in open court, made default in appearing.
But one of the 'Wissenden' was in no respect
liable to the summary process, or to the inquisitorial
proceeding, unless he had revealed the secrets of the
Court. He was presumed to be a true man; and if
accused upon vehement suspicion, or 'Leumund,' the
same presumption or evil repute which was fatal to
the uninitiated might be entirely rebutted by the compurgatory
oath of the free Echevin. If a party,
accused by appeal, did not shun investigation, he
appeared in the open court, and defended himself
according to the ordinary rules of law. If he absconded,
or if the evidence or presumptions were against him,
the accusation then came before the Judges of the
Secret Court, who pronounced the doom. The accusatorial
process, as it was termed, was also, in many
cases, brought in the first instance before the 'Heimliche
Acht.' Proceeding upon the examination of
witnesses, it possessed no peculiar character, and its
forms were those of the ordinary courts of justice. It
was only in this manner that one of the 'Wissenden,'
or Witan, could be tried; and the privilege of being
exempted from the summary process, or from the effects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVI" id="Page_XXVI">xxvi</a></span>
of the 'Leumund,' appears to have been one of the
reasons which induced so many of those who did not
tread the 'red earth' to seek to be included in the
Vehmic bond.</p>

<p>"There was no mystery in the assembly of the
Heimliche Acht. Under the oak, or under the lime-tree,
the Judges assembled, in broad daylight, and
before the eye of heaven; but the tribunal derived its
name from the precautions which were taken, for the
purpose of preventing any disclosure of its proceedings
which might enable the offender to escape the
vengeance of the Vehme. Hence, the fearful oath
of secrecy which bound the Echevins. And if any
stranger was found present in the Court, the unlucky
intruder instantly forfeited his life as a punishment
for his temerity. If the presentment or denunciation
did chance to become known to the offender, the law
allowed him a right of appeal. But the permission
was of very little utility, it was a profitless boon, for
the Vehmic Judges always laboured to conceal the
judgment from the hapless criminal, who seldom was
aware of his sentence until his neck was encircled by
the halter.</p>

<p>"Charlemagne, according to the traditions of Westphalia,
was the founder of the Vehmic tribunal; and
it was supposed that he instituted the Court for the
purpose of coercing the Saxons, ever ready to relapse
into the idolatry from which they had been reclaimed,
not by persuasion, but by the sword. This opinion,
however, is not confirmed either by documentary evidence
or by contemporary historians. And if we
examine the proceedings of the Vehmic tribunal, we
shall see that, in principle, it differs in no essential
character from the summary jurisdiction exercised in
the townships and hundreds of Anglo-Saxon England.
Amongst us, the thief or the robber was equally liable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVII" id="Page_XXVII">xxvii</a></span>
to summary punishment, if apprehended by the men
of the township; and the same rules disqualified them
from proceeding to summary execution. An English
outlaw was exactly in the situation of him who had
escaped from the hands of the Echevins, or who had
failed to appear before the Vehmic Court: he was
condemned unheard, nor was he confronted with his
accusers. The inquisitorial proceedings, as they are
termed by the German jurists, are identical with our
ancient presentments. Presumptions are substituted
for proofs, and general opinion holds the place of a
responsible accuser. He who was untrue to all the
people in the Saxon age, or liable to the malecredence
of the inquest at a subsequent period, was scarcely
more fortunate than he who was branded as 'Leumund'
by the Vehmic law.</p>

<p>"In cases of open delict and of outlawry, there was
substantially no difference whatever between the English
and the Vehmic proceedings. But in the inquisitorial
process, the delinquent was allowed, according
to our older code, to run the risk of the ordeal. He
was accused by or before the Hundred, or the Thanes
of the Wapentake; and his own oath cleared him, if a
true man; but he 'bore the iron' if unable to avail
himself of the credit derived from a good and fair reputation.
The same course may have been originally
adopted in Westphalia; for the 'Wissend,' when
accused, could exculpate himself by his compurgatory
oath, being presumed to be of good fame; and it is,
therefore, probable that an uninitiated offender, standing
a stage lower in character and credibility, was
allowed the last resort of the ordeal. But when the
'Judgment of God' was abolished by the decrees of
the Church, it did not occur to the Vehmic Judges to
put the offender upon his second trial by the visne,
which now forms the distinguishing characteristic of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVIII" id="Page_XXVIII">xxviii</a></span>
the English law, and he was at once considered as condemned.
The Heimliche Acht is a presentment not
traversable by the offender.</p>

<p>"<i>The Vehmic Tribunals can only be considered as
the original jurisdictions of the 'Old Saxons,' which
survived the subjugation of their country. The singular
and mystic forms of initiation, the system of
enigmatical phrases, the use of the signs and symbols
of recognition, may probably be ascribed to the period
when the whole system was united to the worship of
the Deities of Vengeance, and when the sentence was
promulgated by the Doomsmen, assembled, like the Asi
of old, before the altars of Thor or Woden.</i> Of this
connection with ancient pagan policy, so clearly to be
traced in the Icelandic Courts, the English territorial
jurisdictions offer some very faint vestiges; but the
mystery had long been dispersed, and the whole system
passed into the ordinary machinery of the law.</p>

<p>"As to the Vehmic Tribunals, it is acknowledged,
that in a truly barbarous age and country, their proceedings,
however violent, were not without utility.
Their severe and secret vengeance often deterred the
rapacity of the noble robber, and protected the humble
suppliant; the extent, and even the abuse, of their
authority was in some measure justified in an Empire
divided into numerous independent jurisdictions, and
not subjected to any paramount tribunal, able to
administer impartial justice to the oppressed. But as
the times improved, the Vehmic tribunals degenerated.
The Echevins, chosen from the inferior ranks, did not
possess any personal consideration. Opposed by the
opulent cities of the Hanse, and objects of the suspicion
and the enmity of the powerful aristocracy, the
tribunals of some districts were abolished by law, and
others took the form of ordinary territorial jurisdictions;
the greater number fell into desuetude. Yet, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIX" id="Page_XXIX">xxix</a></span>
late as the middle of the eighteenth century, a few
Vehmic tribunals existed in name, though, as it may
be easily supposed, without possessing any remnant of
their pristine power."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Palgrave</span> <i>on the Rise and

<p>I have marked <i>by italic letters</i> the most important
passage of the above quotation. The view it contains
seems to me to have every appearance of truth and
justice&mdash;and if such should, on maturer investigation,
turn out to be the fact, it will certainly confer no
small honour on an English scholar to have discovered
the key to a mystery, which had long exercised in
vain the laborious and profound students of German
antiquity.</p>

<p>There are probably several other points on which I
ought to have embraced this opportunity of enlarging;
but the necessity of preparing for an excursion to
foreign countries, in quest of health and strength, that
have been for some time sinking, makes me cut short
my address upon the present occasion.</p>

<p>Although I had never been in Switzerland, and
numerous mistakes must of course have occurred in my
attempts to describe the local scenery of that romantic
region, I must not conclude without a statement highly
gratifying to myself, that the work met with a reception
of more than usual cordiality among the descendants
of the Alpine heroes whose manners I had
ventured to treat of; and I have in particular to
express my thanks to the several Swiss gentlemen who
have, since the novel was published, enriched my little
collection of armour with specimens of the huge weapon
that sheared the lances of the Austrian chivalry at
Sempach, and was employed with equal success on the
bloody days of Granson and Morat. Of the ancient
doublehanded <i>espadons</i> of the Switzer, I have, in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXX" id="Page_XXX">xxx</a></span>
way, received, I think, not less than six, in excellent
preservation, from as many different individuals, who
thus testified their general approbation of these pages.
They are not the less interesting, that gigantic swords,
of nearly the same pattern and dimensions, were
employed, in their conflicts with the bold knights and
men-at-arms of England, by Wallace, and the sturdy
foot-soldiers who, under his guidance, laid the foundations
of Scottish independence.</p>

<p>The reader who wishes to examine with attention
the historical events of the period which the novel
embraces will find ample means of doing so in the valuable
works of Zschokké and M. de Barante&mdash;which
last author's account of the Dukes of Burgundy is
among the most valuable of recent accessions of European
literature&mdash;and in the new Parisian edition of
Froissart, which has not as yet attracted so much
attention in this country as it well deserves to do.</p>

<p>The course of four centuries has well-nigh elapsed
since the series of events which are related in the
following chapters took place on the Continent.
The records which contained the outlines of the
history, and might be referred to as proof of its
veracity, were long preserved in the superb library
of the Monastery of St. Gall, but perished, with
many of the literary treasures of that establishment,
when the convent was plundered by the
French revolutionary armies. The events are
fixed, by historical date, to the middle of the fifteenth
century&mdash;that important period, when
chivalry still shone with a setting ray, soon about
to be totally obscured: in some countries, by the
establishment of free institutions; in others, by that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
of arbitrary power, which alike rendered useless
the interference of those self-endowed redressers
of wrongs, whose only warrant of authority was
the sword.</p>

<p>Amid the general light which had recently shone
upon Europe, France, Burgundy, and Italy, but
more especially Austria, had been made acquainted
with the character of a people of whose very existence
they had before been scarcely conscious. It
is true, that the inhabitants of those countries
which lie in the vicinity of the Alps, that immense
barrier, were not ignorant that, notwithstanding
their rugged and desolate appearance, the
secluded valleys which winded among those gigantic
mountains nourished a race of hunters and
shepherds; men who, living in a state of primeval
simplicity, compelled from the soil a subsistence
gained by severe labour, followed the chase over
the most savage precipices and through the darkest
pine forests, or drove their cattle to spots which
afforded them a scanty pasturage, even in the vicinage
of eternal snows. But the existence of such
a people, or rather of a number of small communities
who followed nearly the same poor and hardy
course of life, had seemed to the rich and powerful
princes in the neighbourhood a matter of as little
consequence, as it is to the stately herds which
repose in a fertile meadow, that a few half-starved
goats find their scanty food among the rocks which
overlook their rich domain.</p>

<p>But wonder and attention began to be attracted
towards these mountaineers, about the middle of
the fourteenth century, when reports were spread
abroad of severe contests, in which the German
chivalry, endeavouring to suppress insurrections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
among their Alpine vassals, had sustained repeated
and bloody defeats, although having on their side
numbers and discipline, and the advantage of the
most perfect military equipment then known and
confided in. Great was the wonder that cavalry,
which made the only efficient part of the feudal
armies of these ages, should be routed by men on
foot; that warriors sheathed in complete steel
should be overpowered by naked peasants who wore
no defensive armour, and were irregularly provided
with pikes, halberts, and clubs, for the purpose
of attack; above all, it seemed a species of miracle,
that knights and nobles of the highest birth should
be defeated by mountaineers and shepherds. But
the repeated victories of the Swiss at Laupen,
Sempach [<a href="#ednote_a" name="enanchor_a" id="enanchor_a" ><i>a</i></a>],<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and on other less distinguished occasions,
plainly intimated that a new principle of
civil organisation, as well as of military movements,
had arisen amid the stormy regions of
Helvetia.</p>

<p>Still, although the decisive victories which
obtained liberty for the Swiss Cantons, as well as
the spirit of resolution and wisdom with which
the members of the little confederation had maintained
themselves against the utmost exertions of
Austria, had spread their fame abroad through all
the neighbouring countries; and although they
themselves were conscious of the character and
actual power which repeated victories had acquired
for themselves and their country, yet down to the
middle of the fifteenth century, and at a later date,
the Swiss retained in a great measure the wisdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
moderation, and simplicity of their ancient manners;
so much so, that those who were intrusted
with the command of the troops of the Republic in
battle, were wont to resume the shepherd's staff
when they laid down the truncheon, and, like the
Roman dictators, to retire to complete equality
with their fellow-citizens, from the eminence of
military command to which their talents, and the
call of their country, had raised them.</p>

<p>It is, then, in the Forest Cantons of Switzerland,
in the autumn of 1474, while these districts were
in the rude and simple state we have described,
that our tale opens.</p>

<p class="p2">Two travellers, one considerably past the prime
of life, the other probably two or three and twenty
years old, had passed the night at the little town of
Lucerne, the capital of the Swiss state of the same
name, and beautifully situated on the Lake of the
Four Cantons. Their dress and character seemed
those of merchants of a higher class, and while
they themselves journeyed on foot, the character
of the country rendering that by far the most easy
mode of pursuing their route, a young peasant lad,
from the Italian side of the Alps, followed them
with a sumpter mule, laden apparently with men's
wares and baggage, which he sometimes mounted,
but more frequently led by the bridle.</p>

<p>The travellers were uncommonly fine-looking
men, and seemed connected by some very near
relationship,&mdash;probably that of father and son;
for at the little inn where they lodged on the preceding
evening, the great deference and respect
paid by the younger to the elder had not escaped
the observation of the natives, who, like other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
sequestered beings, were curious in proportion to
the limited means of information which they possessed.
They observed also, that the merchants,
under pretence of haste, declined opening their
bales, or proposing traffic to the inhabitants of
Lucerne, alleging in excuse that they had no commodities
fitted for the market. The females of the
town were the more displeased with the reserve of
the mercantile travellers, because they were given
to understand that it was occasioned by the wares
in which they dealt being too costly to find customers
among the Helvetian mountains; for it had
transpired, by means of their attendant, that the
strangers had visited Venice, and had there made
many purchases of rich commodities, which were
brought from India and Egypt to that celebrated
emporium, as to the common mart of the Western
World, and thence dispersed into all quarters of
Europe. Now the Swiss maidens had of late made
the discovery that gauds and gems were fair to
look upon, and, though without the hope of being
able to possess themselves of such ornaments, they
felt a natural desire to review and handle the rich
stores of the merchants, and some displeasure at
being prevented from doing so.</p>

<p>It was also observed, that though the strangers
were sufficiently courteous in their demeanour,
they did not evince that studious anxiety to please,
displayed by the travelling pedlars or merchants
of Lombardy or Savoy, by whom the inhabitants
of the mountains were occasionally visited; and
who had been more frequent in their rounds of
late years, since the spoils of victory had invested
the Swiss with some wealth, and had taught many
of them new wants. Those peripatetic traders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
were civil and assiduous, as their calling required;
but the new visitors seemed men who were indifferent
to traffic, or at least to such slender gains
as could be gathered in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Curiosity was further excited by the circumstance
that they spoke to each other in a language
which was certainly neither German, Italian, nor
French, but from which an old man serving in the
cabaret, who had once been as far as Paris, supposed
they might be English; a people of whom it
was only known in these mountains, that they
were a fierce insular race, at war with the French
for many years, and a large body of whom had
long since invaded the Forest Cantons [<a href="#ednote_b" name="enanchor_b" id="enanchor_b" ><i>b</i></a>], and sustained
such a defeat in the valley of Russwyl as
was well remembered by the grey-haired men of
Lucerne, who received the tale from their fathers.</p>

<p>The lad who attended the strangers was soon
ascertained to be a youth from the Grisons country,
who acted as their guide, so far as his knowledge
of the mountains permitted. He said they
designed to go to Bâle, but seemed desirous to
travel by circuitous and unfrequented routes. The
circumstances just mentioned increased the general
desire to know more of the travellers and of their
merchandise. Not a bale, however, was unpacked,
and the merchants, leaving Lucerne next morning,
resumed their toilsome journey, preferring a circuitous
route and bad roads, through the peaceful
cantons of Switzerland, to encountering the exactions
and rapine of the robber chivalry of Germany,
who, like so many sovereigns, made war each at
his own pleasure, and levied tolls and taxes on
every one who passed their domains, of a mile's
breadth, with all the insolence of petty tyranny.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>For several hours after leaving Lucerne, the
journey of our travellers was successfully prosecuted.
The road, though precipitous and difficult,
was rendered interesting by those splendid phenomena,
which no country exhibits in a more
astonishing manner than the mountains of Switzerland,
where the rocky pass, the verdant valley,
the broad lake, and the rushing torrent, the attributes
of other hills as well as these, are interspersed
with the magnificent and yet fearful horrors
of the glaciers, a feature peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>It was not an age in which the beauties or grandeur
of a landscape made much impression either
on the minds of those who travelled through the
country, or who resided in it. To the latter, the
objects, however dignified, were familiar, and associated
with daily habits and with daily toil; and
the former saw, perhaps, more terror than beauty
in the wild region through which they passed, and
were rather solicitous to get safe to their night's
quarters, than to comment on the grandeur of the
scenes which lay between them and their place of
rest. Yet our merchants, as they proceeded on
their journey, could not help being strongly impressed
by the character of the scenery around
them. Their road lay along the side of the lake,
at times level and close on its very margin, at
times rising to a great height on the side of the
mountain, and winding along the verge of precipices
which sank down to the water as sharp and
sheer as the wall of a castle descending upon the
ditch which defends it. At other times it traversed
spots of a milder character,&mdash;delightful
green slopes, and lowly retired valleys, affording
both pasturage and arable ground, sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
watered by small streams, which winded by the
hamlet of wooden huts with their fantastic little
church and steeple, meandered round the orchard
and the mount of vines, and, murmuring gently as
they flowed, found a quiet passage into the lake.</p>

<p>"That stream, Arthur," said the elder traveller,
as with one consent they stopped to gaze on such a
scene as I have described, "resembles the life of a
good and a happy man."</p>

<p>"And the brook, which hurries itself headlong
down yon distant hill, marking its course by a
streak of white foam," answered Arthur,&mdash;"what
does that resemble?"</p>

<p>"That of a brave and unfortunate one," replied
his father.</p>

<p>"The torrent for me," said Arthur; "a headlong
course which no human force can oppose, and then
let it be as brief as it is glorious."</p>

<p>"It is a young man's thought," replied his
father; "but I am well aware that it is so rooted
in thy heart, that nothing but the rude hand of
adversity can pluck it up."</p>

<p>"As yet the root clings fast to my heart's
strings," said the young man; "and methinks
adversity's hand hath had a fair grasp of it."</p>

<p>"You speak, my son, of what you little understand,"
said his father. "Know, that till the
middle of life be passed, men scarce distinguish
true prosperity from adversity, or rather they court
as the favours of fortune what they should more
justly regard as the marks of her displeasure.
Look at yonder mountain, which wears on its
shaggy brow a diadem of clouds, now raised and
now depressed, while the sun glances upon, but is
unable to dispel it;&mdash;a child might believe it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
be a crown of glory&mdash;a man knows it to be the
signal of tempest."</p>

<p>Arthur followed the direction of his father's eye
to the dark and shadowy eminence of Mount
Pilatus.</p>

<p>"Is the mist on yonder wild mountain so ominous,
then?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>"Demand of Antonio," said his father; "he will
tell you the legend."</p>

<p>The young merchant addressed himself to the
Swiss lad who acted as their attendant, desiring to
know the name of the gloomy height, which, in
that quarter, seems the leviathan of the huge congregation
of mountains assembled about Lucerne.</p>

<p>The lad crossed himself devoutly, as he recounted
the popular legend, that the wicked Pontius Pilate,
Proconsul of Judea, had here found the termination
of his impious life; having, after spending
years in the recesses of that mountain which bears
his name, at length, in remorse and despair rather
than in penitence, plunged into the dismal lake
which occupies the summit. Whether water refused
to do the executioner's duty upon such a
wretch, or whether, his body being drowned, his
vexed spirit continued to haunt the place where
he committed suicide, Antonio did not pretend to
explain. But a form was often, he said, seen to
emerge from the gloomy waters, and go through
the action of one washing his hands; and when he
did so, dark clouds of mist gathered first round the
bosom of the Infernal Lake (such it had been
styled of old), and then, wrapping the whole
upper part of the mountain in darkness, presaged
a tempest or hurricane, which was sure to follow
in a short space. He added, that the evil spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
was peculiarly exasperated at the audacity of such
strangers as ascended the mountain to gaze at his
place of punishment, and that, in consequence, the
magistrates of Lucerne had prohibited any one
from approaching Mount Pilatus, under severe
penalties. Antonio once more crossed himself as
he finished his legend; in which act of devotion
he was imitated by his hearers, too good Catholics
to entertain any doubt of the truth of the story.</p>

<p>"How the accursed heathen scowls upon us!"
said the younger of the merchants, while the cloud
darkened and seemed to settle on the brow of
Mount Pilatus. "<i>Vade retro!</i> Be thou defied,
sinner!"</p>

<p>A rising wind, rather heard than felt, seemed to
groan forth, in the tone of a dying lion, the acceptance
of the suffering spirit to the rash challenge
of the young Englishman. The mountain was
seen to send down its rugged sides thick wreaths
of heaving mist, which, rolling through the rugged
chasms that seamed the grisly hill, resembled torrents
of rushing lava pouring down from a volcano.
The ridgy precipices, which formed the sides of
these huge ravines, showed their splintery and
rugged edges over the vapour, as if dividing from
each other the descending streams of mist which
rolled around them. As a strong contrast to this
gloomy and threatening scene, the more distant
mountain range of Rigi shone brilliant with all
the hues of an autumnal sun.</p>

<p>While the travellers watched this striking and
varied contrast, which resembled an approaching
combat betwixt the powers of Light and Darkness,
their guide, in his mixed jargon of Italian and
German, exhorted them to make haste on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
journey. The village to which he proposed to
conduct them, he said, was yet distant, the road
bad, and difficult to find, and if the Evil One
(looking to Mount Pilatus, and crossing himself)
should send his darkness upon the valley, the path
would be both doubtful and dangerous. The travellers,
thus admonished, gathered the capes of
their cloaks close round their throats, pulled their
bonnets resolvedly over their brows, drew the
buckle of the broad belts which fastened their
mantles, and each with a mountain staff in his
hand, well shod with an iron spike, they pursued
their journey, with unabated strength and undaunted
spirit.</p>

<p>With every step the scenes around them appeared
to change. Each mountain, as if its firm
and immutable form were flexible and varying,
altered in appearance, like that of a shadowy
apparition, as the position of the strangers relative
to them changed with their motions, and as the
mist, which continued slowly though constantly
to descend, influenced the rugged aspect of the
hills and valleys which it shrouded with its
vapoury mantle. The nature of their progress,
too, never direct, but winding by a narrow path
along the sinuosities of the valley, and making
many a circuit round precipices and other obstacles
which it was impossible to surmount, added to the
wild variety of a journey, in which, at last, the
travellers totally lost any vague idea which they
had previously entertained concerning the direction
in which the road led them.</p>

<p>"I would," said the elder, "we had that mystical
needle which mariners talk of, that points ever
to the north, and enables them to keep their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
on the waters, when there is neither cape nor
headland, sun, moon, nor stars, nor any mark in
heaven or earth, to tell them how to steer."</p>

<p>"It would scarce avail us among these mountains,"
answered the youth; "for though that
wonderful needle may keep its point to the northern
Pole-star, when it is on a flat surface like the
sea, it is not to be thought it would do so when
these huge mountains arise like walls, betwixt the
steel and the object of its sympathy."</p>

<p>"I fear me," replied the father, "we shall find
our guide, who has been growing hourly more
stupid since he left his own valley, as useless as
you suppose the compass would be among the hills
of this wild country.&mdash;Canst tell, my boy," said
he, addressing Antonio in bad Italian, "if we be
in the road we purposed?"</p>

<p>"If it please St. Antonio"&mdash;said the guide,
who was obviously too much confused to answer
the question directly.</p>

<p>"And that water, half covered with mist, which
glimmers through the fog, at the foot of this huge
black precipice&mdash;is it still a part of the Lake of
Lucerne, or have we lighted upon another since we
ascended that last hill?"</p>

<p>Antonio could only answer that they ought to
be on the Lake of Lucerne still, and that he hoped
that what they saw below them was only a winding
branch of the same sheet of water. But he
could say nothing with certainty.</p>

<p>"Dog of an Italian!" exclaimed the younger
traveller, "thou deservest to have thy bones
broken, for undertaking a charge which thou art
as incapable to perform as thou art to guide us to
heaven!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>"Peace, Arthur," said his father; "if you
frighten the lad, he runs off, and we lose the small
advantage we might have by his knowledge; if
you use your baton, he rewards you with the stab
of a knife,&mdash;for such is the humour of a revengeful
Lombard. Either way, you are marred instead
of helped.&mdash;Hark thee hither, my boy," he continued,
in his indifferent Italian, "be not afraid
of that hot youngster, whom I will not permit to
injure thee; but tell me, if thou canst, the names
of the villages by which we are to make our journey
to-day."</p>

<p>The gentle mode in which the elder traveller
spoke reassured the lad, who had been somewhat
alarmed at the harsh tone and menacing expressions
of his younger companion; and he poured
forth, in his patois, a flood of names, in which
the German guttural sounds were strangely intermixed
with the soft accents of the Italian, but
which carried to the hearer no intelligible information
concerning the object of his question; so
that at length he was forced to conclude, "Even
lead on, in Our Lady's name, or in St. Antonio's,
if you like it better: we shall but lose time, I see,
in trying to understand each other."</p>

<p>They moved on as before, with this difference,
that the guide, leading the mule, now went first,
and was followed by the other two, whose motions
he had formerly directed by calling to them from
behind. The clouds meantime became thicker and
thicker, and the mist, which had at first been a
thin vapour, began now to descend in the form of a
small thick rain, which gathered like dew upon
the capotes of the travellers. Distant rustling and
groaning sounds were heard among the remote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
mountains, similar to those by which the Evil
Spirit of Mount Pilatus had seemed to announce
the storm. The boy again pressed his companions
to advance, but at the same time threw impediments
in the way of their doing so, by the slowness
and indecision which he showed in leading
them on.</p>

<p>Having proceeded in this manner for three or
four miles, which uncertainty rendered doubly
tedious, the travellers were at length engaged in a
narrow path, running along the verge of a precipice.
Beneath was water, but of what description
they could not ascertain. The wind, indeed,
which began to be felt in sudden gusts, sometimes
swept aside the mist so completely as to show the
waves glimmering below; but whether they were
those of the same lake on which their morning journey
had commenced, whether it was another and
separate sheet of water of a similar character, or
whether it was a river or large brook, the view
afforded was too indistinct to determine. Thus
far was certain, that they were not on the shores
of the Lake of Lucerne, where it displays its
usual expanse of waters; for the same hurricane
gusts which showed them water in the bottom of
the glen gave them a transient view of the opposite
side, at what exact distance they could not
well discern, but near enough to show tall abrupt
rocks and shaggy pine-trees, here united in groups,
and there singly anchored among the cliffs which
overhung the water. This was a more distinct
landscape than the farther side of the lake would
have offered, had they been on the right road.</p>

<p>Hitherto the path, though steep and rugged, was
plainly enough indicated, and showed traces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
having been used both by riders and foot passengers.
But suddenly, as Antonio with the loaded
mule had reached a projecting eminence, around
the peak of which the path made a sharp turn,
he stopped short, with his usual exclamation,
addressed to his patron saint. It appeared to
Arthur that the mule shared the terrors of the
guide; for it started back, put forwards its fore
feet separate from each other, and seemed, by the
attitude which it assumed, to intimate a determination
to resist every proposal to advance, at the
same time expressing horror and fear at the prospect
which lay before it.</p>

<p>Arthur pressed forward, not only from curiosity,
but that he might if possible bear the brunt of any
danger before his father came up to share it. In
less time than we have taken to tell the story, the
young man stood beside Antonio and the mule,
upon a platform of rock on which the road seemed
absolutely to terminate, and from the farther side
of which a precipice sank sheer down, to what
depth the mist did not permit him to discern, but
certainly uninterrupted for more than three hundred
feet.</p>

<p>The blank expression which overcast the visage
of the younger traveller, and traces of which might
be discerned in the physiognomy of the beast of
burden, announced alarm and mortification at this
unexpected and, as it seemed, insurmountable obstacle.
Nor did the looks of the father, who presently
after came up to the same spot, convey either
hope or comfort. He stood with the others gazing
on the misty gulf beneath them, and looking all
around, but in vain, for some continuation of the
path, which certainly had never been originally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
designed to terminate in this summary manner.
As they stood uncertain what to do next, the son
in vain attempting to discover some mode of passing
onward, and the father about to propose that
they should return by the road which had brought
them hither, a loud howl of the wind, more wild
than they had yet heard, swept down the valley.
All being aware of the danger of being hurled
from the precarious station which they occupied,
snatched at bushes and rocks by which to secure
themselves, and even the poor mule seemed to
steady itself in order to withstand the approaching
hurricane. The gust came with such unexpected
fury that it appeared to the travellers to shake the
very rock on which they stood, and would have
swept them from its surface like so many dry
leaves, had it not been for the momentary precautions
which they had taken for their safety. But
as the wind rushed down the glen, it completely
removed for the space of three or four minutes the
veil of mist which former gusts had only served to
agitate or discompose, and showed them the nature
and cause of the interruption which they had met
with so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The rapid but correct eye of Arthur was then
able to ascertain that the path, after leaving the
platform of rock on which they stood, had originally
passed upwards in the same direction along
the edge of a steep bank of earth, which had then
formed the upper covering of a stratum of precipitous
rocks. But it had chanced, in some of the
convulsions of nature which take place in those
wild regions, where she works upon a scale so
formidable, that the earth had made a slip, or
almost a precipitous descent, from the rock, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
been hurled downwards with the path, which was
traced along the top, and with bushes, trees, or
whatever grew upon it, into the channel of the
stream; for such they could now discern the water
beneath them to be, and not a lake, or an arm of
a lake, as they had hitherto supposed.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of this phenomenon might
probably have been an earthquake, not unfrequent
in that country. The bank of earth, now a confused
mass of ruins inverted in its fall, showed
some trees growing in a horizontal position, and
others, which, having pitched on their heads in
their descent, were at once inverted and shattered
to pieces, and lay a sport to the streams of the
river which they had heretofore covered with
gloomy shadow. The gaunt precipice which
remained behind, like the skeleton of some huge
monster divested of its flesh, formed the wall of a
fearful abyss, resembling the face of a newly
wrought quarry, more dismal of aspect from the
rawness of its recent formation, and from its being
as yet uncovered with any of the vegetation with
which nature speedily mantles over the bare surface
even of her sternest crags and precipices.</p>

<p>Besides remarking these appearances, which
tended to show that this interruption of the road
had been of recent occurrence, Arthur was able to
observe, on the farther side of the river, higher up
the valley, and rising out of the pine forests, interspersed
with rocks, a square building of considerable
height, like the ruins of a Gothic tower. He
pointed out this remarkable object to Antonio, and
demanded if he knew it; justly conjecturing that,
from the peculiarity of the site, it was a landmark
not easily to be forgotten by any who had seen it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
before. Accordingly, it was gladly and promptly
recognised by the lad, who called out cheerfully
that the place was Geierstein&mdash;that is, as he explained
it, the Rock of the Vultures. He knew
it, he said, by the old tower, as well as by a huge
pinnacle of rock which arose near it, almost in the
form of a steeple, to the top of which the lammer-geier
(one of the largest birds of prey known to
exist) had in former days transported the child of
an ancient lord of the castle. He proceeded to
recount the vow which was made by the Knight of
Geierstein to Our Lady of Einsiedlen; and, while
he spoke, the castle, rocks, woods, and precipices
again faded in mist. But as he concluded his wonderful
narrative with the miracle which restored
the infant again to its father's arms, he cried out
suddenly, "Look to yourselves&mdash;the storm!&mdash;the
storm!" It came accordingly, and, sweeping the
mist before it, again bestowed on the travellers a
view of the horrors around them.</p>

<p>"Ay!" quoth Antonio, triumphantly, as the
gust abated, "old Pontius loves little to hear of
Our Lady of Einsiedlen; but she will keep her
own with him&mdash;Ave Maria!"</p>

<p>"That tower," said the young traveller, "seems
uninhabited. I can descry no smoke, and the
battlement appears ruinous."</p>

<p>"It has not been inhabited for many a day,"
answered the guide. "But I would I were at
it, for all that. Honest Arnold Biederman, the
Landamman [chief magistrate] of the Canton of
Unterwalden, dwells near, and, I warrant you, distressed
strangers will not want the best that cupboard
and cellar can find them, wherever he holds
rule."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"I have heard of him," said the elder traveller,
whom Antonio had been taught to call Seignor
Philipson; "a good and hospitable man, and one
who enjoys deserved weight with his countrymen."</p>

<p>"You have spoken him right, Seignor," answered
the guide: "and I would we could reach his house,
where you should be sure of hospitable treatment,
and a good direction for your next day's journey.
But how we are to get to the Vulture's Castle, unless
we had wings like the vulture, is a question
hard to answer."</p>

<p>Arthur replied by a daring proposal, which the
reader will find in the next chapter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>After surveying the desolate scene as accurately
as the stormy state of the atmosphere would permit,
the younger of the travellers observed, "In
any other country, I should say the tempest begins
to abate; but what to expect in this land of desolation,
it were rash to decide. If the apostate
spirit of Pilate be actually on the blast, these
lingering and more distant howls seem to intimate
that he is returning to his place of punishment.
The pathway has sunk with the ground on which
it was traced&mdash;I can see part of it lying down in
the abyss, marking, as with a streak of clay, yonder
mass of earth and stone. But I think it possible,
with your permission, my father, that I could
still scramble forward along the edge of the precipice,
till I come in sight of the habitation which
the lad tells us of. If there be actually such a one,
there must be an access to it somewhere; and if I
cannot find the path out, I can at least make a
signal to those who dwell near the Vulture's Nest
yonder, and obtain some friendly guidance."</p>

<p>"I cannot consent to your incurring such a
risk," said his father; "let the lad go forward, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
he can and will. He is mountain-bred, and I
will reward him richly."</p>

<p>But Antonio declined the proposal absolutely
and decidedly. "I am mountain-bred," he said,
"but I am no chamois-hunter; and I have no
wings to transport me from cliff to cliff, like a
raven&mdash;gold is not worth life."</p>

<p>"And God forbid," said Seignor Philipson,
"that I should tempt thee to weigh them against
each other!&mdash;Go on, then, my son&mdash;I follow
thee."</p>

<p>"Under your favour, dearest sir, no," replied
the young man; "it is enough to endanger the life
of one&mdash;and mine, far the most worthless, should,
by all the rules of wisdom as well as nature, be
put first in hazard."</p>

<p>"No, Arthur," replied his father, in a determined
voice; "no, my son&mdash;I have survived
much, but I will not survive thee."</p>

<p>"I fear not for the issue, father, if you permit
me to go alone; but I cannot&mdash;dare not&mdash;undertake
a task so perilous, if you persist in attempting
to share it, with no better aid than mine. While
I endeavoured to make a new advance, I should be
ever looking back to see how you might attain the
station which I was about to leave&mdash;And bethink
you, dearest father, that if I fall, I fall an unregarded
thing, of as little moment as the stone or
tree which has toppled headlong down before me.
But you&mdash;should your foot slip, or your hand fail,
bethink you what and how much must needs fall
with you!"</p>

<p>"Thou art right, my child," said the father.
"I still have that which binds me to life, even
though I were to lose in thee all that is dear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
me.&mdash;Our Lady and our Lady's Knight bless thee
and prosper thee, my child! Thy foot is young,
thy hand is strong&mdash;thou hast not climbed Plynlimmon
in vain. Be bold, but be wary&mdash;remember
there is a man who, failing thee, has but one
act of duty to bind him to the earth, and, that discharged,
will soon follow thee."</p>

<p>The young man accordingly prepared for his
journey, and, stripping himself of his cumbrous
cloak, showed his well-proportioned limbs in a
jerkin of grey cloth, which sat close to his person.
The father's resolution gave way when his son
turned round to bid him farewell. He recalled
his permission, and in a peremptory tone forbade
him to proceed. But, without listening to the
prohibition, Arthur had commenced his perilous
adventure. Descending from the platform on
which he stood, by the boughs of an old ash-tree,
which thrust itself out of the cleft of a rock, the
youth was enabled to gain, though at great risk, a
narrow ledge, the very brink of the precipice, by
creeping along which he hoped to pass on till he
made himself heard or seen from the habitation,
of whose existence the guide had informed him.
His situation, as he pursued this bold purpose,
appeared so precarious, that even the hired attendant
hardly dared to draw breath as he gazed on
him. The ledge which supported him seemed to
grow so narrow, as he passed along it, as to become
altogether invisible, while sometimes with his
face to the precipice, sometimes looking forward,
sometimes glancing his eyes upward, but never
venturing to cast a look below, lest his brain
should grow giddy at a sight so appalling, he
wound his way onward. To his father and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
attendant, who beheld his progress, it was less
that of a man advancing in the ordinary manner,
and resting by aught connected with the firm
earth, than that of an insect crawling along the
face of a perpendicular wall, of whose progressive
movement we are indeed sensible, but cannot perceive
the means of its support. And bitterly, most
bitterly, did the miserable parent now lament,
that he had not persisted in his purpose to encounter
the baffling and even perilous measure of
retracing his steps to the habitation of the preceding
night. He should then, at least, have
partaken the fate of the son of his love.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the young man's spirits were strongly
braced for the performance of his perilous task.
He laid a powerful restraint on his imagination,
which in general was sufficiently active, and refused
to listen, even for an instant, to any of the
horrible insinuations by which fancy augments
actual danger. He endeavoured manfully to reduce
all around him to the scale of right reason, as the
best support of true courage. "This ledge of rock,"
he urged to himself, "is but narrow, yet it has
breadth enough to support me; these cliffs and
crevices in the surface are small and distant, but
the one affords as secure a resting-place to my feet,
the other as available a grasp to my hands, as if I
stood on a platform of a cubit broad, and rested
my arm on a balustrade of marble. My safety,
therefore, depends on myself. If I move with
decision, step firmly, and hold fast, what signifies
how near I am to the mouth of an abyss?"</p>

<p>Thus estimating the extent of his danger by the
measure of sound sense and reality, and supported
by some degree of practice in such exercise, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
brave youth went forward on his awful journey,
step by step, winning his way with a caution and
fortitude and presence of mind which alone could
have saved him from instant destruction. At
length he gained a point where a projecting rock
formed the angle of the precipice, so far as it had
been visible to him from the platform. This,
therefore, was the critical point of his undertaking;
but it was also the most perilous part of it.
The rock projected more than six feet forward over
the torrent, which he heard raging at the depth of
a hundred yards beneath, with a noise like subterranean
thunder. He examined the spot with
the utmost care, and was led, by the existence of
shrubs, grass, and even stunted trees, to believe
that this rock marked the farthest extent of the
slip or slide of earth, and that, could he but turn
round the angle of which it was the termination,
he might hope to attain the continuation of the
path which had been so strangely interrupted by
this convulsion of nature. But the crag jutted
out so much as to afford no possibility of passing
either under or around it; and as it rose several
feet above the position which Arthur had attained,
it was no easy matter to climb over it. This was,
however, the course which he chose, as the only
mode of surmounting what he hoped might prove
the last obstacle to his voyage of discovery. A
projecting tree afforded him the means of raising
and swinging himself up to the top of the crag.
But he had scarcely planted himself on it, had
scarcely a moment to congratulate himself, on
seeing, amid a wild chaos of cliffs and wood, the
gloomy ruins of Geierstein, with smoke arising,
and indicating something like a human habitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
beside them, when, to his extreme terror, he felt
the huge cliff on which he stood tremble, stoop
slowly forward, and gradually sink from its position.
Projecting as it was, and shaken as its
equilibrium had been by the recent earthquake, it
lay now so insecurely poised, that its balance was
entirely destroyed, even by the addition of the
young man's weight.</p>

<p>Aroused by the imminence of the danger, Arthur,
by an instinctive attempt at self-preservation,
drew cautiously back from the falling crag into
the tree by which he had ascended, and turned
his head back as if spell-bound, to watch the
descent of the fatal rock from which he had just
retreated. It tottered for two or three seconds, as
if uncertain which way to fall, and, had it taken
a sidelong direction, must have dashed the adventurer
from his place of refuge, or borne both the
tree and him headlong down into the river. After
a moment of horrible uncertainty, the power of
gravitation determined a direct and forward descent.
Down went the huge fragment, which
must have weighed at least twenty tons, rending
and splintering in its precipitate course the trees
and bushes which it encountered, and settling at
length in the channel of the torrent, with a din
equal to the discharge of a hundred pieces of artillery.
The sound was re-echoed from bank to bank,
from precipice to precipice, with emulative thunders;
nor was the tumult silent till it rose into the
region of eternal snows, which, equally insensible
to terrestrial sounds and unfavourable to animal
life, heard the roar in their majestic solitude, but
suffered it to die away without a responsive voice.</p>

<p>What, in the meanwhile, were the thoughts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
the distracted father, who saw the ponderous rock
descend, but could not mark whether his only son
had borne it company in its dreadful fall! His
first impulse was to rush forward along the face of
the precipice, which he had seen Arthur so lately
traverse; and when the lad Antonio withheld him,
by throwing his arms around him, he turned on
the guide with the fury of a bear which had been
robbed of her cubs.</p>

<p>"Unhand me, base peasant," he exclaimed, "or
thou diest on the spot!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the poor boy, dropping on his
knees before him, "I too have a father!"</p>

<p>The appeal went to the heart of the traveller,
who instantly let the lad go, and holding up his
hands, and lifting his eyes towards heaven, said,
in accents of the deepest agony, mingled with
devout resignation, "<i>Fiat voluntas tua!</i>&mdash;he was
my last, and loveliest, and best beloved, and most
worthy of my love; and yonder," he added, "yonder
over the glen soar the birds of prey, who are
to feast on his young blood.&mdash;But I will see him
once more," exclaimed the miserable parent, as the
huge carrion vulture floated past him on the thick
air,&mdash;"I will see my Arthur once more, ere the
wolf and the eagle mangle him&mdash;I will see all of
him that earth still holds. Detain me not&mdash;but
abide here, and watch me as I advance. If I fall,
as is most likely, I charge you to take the sealed
papers, which you will find in the valise, and carry
them to the person to whom they are addressed,
with the least possible delay. There is money
enough in the purse to bury me with my poor boy,
and to cause masses be said for our souls, and yet
leave you a rich recompense for your journey."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The honest Swiss lad, obtuse in his understanding,
but kind and faithful in his disposition,
blubbered as his employer spoke, and, afraid to
offer further remonstrance or opposition, saw his
temporary master prepare himself to traverse the
same fatal precipice over the verge of which his
ill-fated son had seemed to pass to the fate which,
with all the wildness of a parent's anguish, his
father was hastening to share.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was heard, from beyond the fatal
angle from which the mass of stone had been displaced
by Arthur's rash ascent, the loud hoarse
sound of one of those huge horns made out of the
spoils of the urus, or wild bull, of Switzerland,
which in ancient times announced the terrors of the
charge of these mountaineers, and, indeed, served
them in war instead of all musical instruments.</p>

<p>"Hold, sir, hold!" exclaimed the Grison.
"Yonder is a signal from Geierstein. Some one
will presently come to our assistance, and show
us the safer way to seek for your son.&mdash;And look
you&mdash;at yon green bush that is glimmering
through the mist, St. Antonio preserve me, as
I see a white cloth displayed there! it is just
beyond the point where the rock fell."</p>

<p>The father endeavoured to fix his eyes on the
spot, but they filled so fast with tears that they
could not discern the object which the guide
pointed out.&mdash;"It is all in vain," he said, dashing
the tears from his eyes&mdash;"I shall never see
more of him than his lifeless remains!"</p>

<p>"You will&mdash;you will see him in life!" said
the Grison. "St. Antonio wills it so&mdash;See, the
white cloth waves again!"</p>

<p>"Some remnant of his garments," said the despairing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
father,&mdash;"some wretched memorial of his
fate.&mdash;No, my eyes see it not&mdash;I have beheld the
fall of my house&mdash;would that the vultures of these
crags had rather torn them from their sockets!"</p>

<p>"Yet look again," said the Swiss; "the cloth
hangs not loose upon a bough&mdash;I can see that it
is raised on the end of a staff, and is distinctly
waved to and fro. Your son makes a signal that
he is safe."</p>

<p>"And if it be so," said the traveller, clasping
his hands together, "blessed be the eyes that see
it, and the tongue that tells it! If we find my
son, and find him alive, this day shall be a lucky
one for thee too."</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the lad, "I only ask that you
will abide still, and act by counsel, and I will
hold myself quit for my services. Only, it is not
creditable to an honest lad to have people lose
themselves by their own wilfulness; for the blame,
after all, is sure to fall upon the guide, as if he
could prevent old Pontius from shaking the mist
from his brow, or banks of earth from slipping
down into the valley at a time, or young harebrained
gallants from walking upon precipices as
narrow as the edge of a knife, or madmen, whose
grey hairs might make them wiser, from drawing
daggers like bravos in Lombardy."</p>

<p>Thus the guide ran on, and in that vein he
might have long continued, for Seignor Philipson
heard him not. Each throb of his pulse, each
thought of his heart, was directed towards the
object which the lad referred to as a signal of his
son's safety. He became at length satisfied that
the signal was actually waved by a human hand;
and, as eager in the glow of reviving hope as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
had of late been under the influence of desperate
grief, he again prepared for the attempt of advancing
towards his son, and assisting him, if possible,
in regaining a place of safety. But the entreaties
and reiterated assurances of his guide induced him
to pause.</p>

<p>"Are you fit," he said, "to go on the crag?
Can you repeat your Credo and Ave without missing
or misplacing a word? for, without that, our
old men say your neck, had you a score of them,
would be in danger.&mdash;Is your eye clear, and your
feet firm?&mdash;I trow the one streams like a fountain,
and the other shakes like the aspen which
overhangs it! Rest here till those arrive who are
far more able to give your son help than either
you or I are. I judge, by the fashion of his blowing,
that yonder is the horn of the Goodman of
Geierstein, Arnold Biederman. He hath seen your
son's danger, and is even now providing for his
safety and ours. There are cases in which the aid
of one stranger, well acquainted with the country,
is worth that of three brothers who know not the
crags."</p>

<p>"But if yonder horn really sounded a signal,"
said the traveller, "how chanced it that my son
replied not?"</p>

<p>"And if he did so, as is most likely he did,"
rejoined the Grison, "how should we have heard
him? The bugle of Uri itself sounded amid these
horrible dins of water and tempest like the reed of
a shepherd boy; and how think you we should
hear the holloa of a man?"</p>

<p>"Yet, methinks," said Seignor Philipson, "I do
hear something amid this roar of elements which
is like a human voice&mdash;but it is not Arthur's."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>"I wot well, no," answered the Grison; "that is
a woman's voice. The maidens will converse with
each other in that manner, from cliff to cliff, through
storm and tempest, were there a mile between."</p>

<p>"Now, Heaven be praised for this providential
relief!" said Seignor Philipson; "I trust we shall
yet see this dreadful day safely ended. I will
holloa in answer."</p>

<p>He attempted to do so, but, inexperienced in the
art of making himself heard in such a country, he
pitched his voice in the same key with that of the
roar of wave and wind; so that, even at twenty
yards from the place where he was speaking, it
must have been totally indistinguishable from
that of the elemental war around them. The lad
smiled at his patron's ineffectual attempts, and
then raised his voice himself in a high, wild, and
prolonged scream, which, while produced with
apparently much less effort than that of the
Englishman, was nevertheless a distinct sound,
separated from others by the key to which it was
pitched, and was probably audible to a very considerable
distance. It was presently answered by
distant cries of the same nature, which gradually
approached the platform, bringing renovated hope
to the anxious traveller.</p>

<p>If the distress of the father rendered his condition
an object of deep compassion, that of the son,
at the same moment, was sufficiently perilous.
We have already stated, that Arthur Philipson
had commenced his precarious journey along the
precipice with all the coolness, resolution, and
unshaken determination of mind which was most
essential to a task where all must depend upon
firmness of nerve. But the formidable accident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
which checked his onward progress was of a
character so dreadful as made him feel all the bitterness
of a death instant, horrible, and, as it
seemed, inevitable. The solid rock had trembled
and rent beneath his footsteps, and although, by
an effort rather mechanical than voluntary, he had
withdrawn himself from the instant ruin attending
its descent, he felt as if the better part of him,
his firmness of mind and strength of body, had
been rent away with the descending rock, as it fell
thundering, with clouds of dust and smoke, into
the torrents and whirlpools of the vexed gulf
beneath. In fact, the seaman swept from the deck
of a wrecked vessel, drenched in the waves, and
battered against the rocks on the shore, does not
differ more from the same mariner, when, at the
commencement of the gale, he stood upon the deck
of his favourite ship, proud of her strength and his
own dexterity, than Arthur, when commencing his
journey, from the same Arthur, while clinging to
the decayed trunk of an old tree, from which, suspended
between heaven and earth, he saw the fall
of the crag which he had so nearly accompanied.
The effects of his terror, indeed, were physical as
well as moral, for a thousand colours played before
his eyes; he was attacked by a sick dizziness, and
deprived at once of the obedience of those limbs
which had hitherto served him so admirably; his
arms and hands, as if no longer at his own command,
now clung to the branches of the tree, with
a cramp-like tenacity over which he seemed to
possess no power, and now trembled in a state of
such complete nervous relaxation as led him to fear
that they were becoming unable to support him
longer in his position.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>An incident, in itself trifling, added to the distress
occasioned by this alienation of his powers.
All living things in the neighbourhood had, as
might be supposed, been startled by the tremendous
fall to which his progress had given occasion.
Flights of owls, bats, and other birds of darkness,
compelled to betake themselves to the air, had lost
no time in returning into their bowers of ivy, or
the harbour afforded them by the rifts and holes of
the neighbouring rocks. One of this ill-omened
flight chanced to be a lammer-geier, or Alpine
vulture, a bird larger and more voracious than the
eagle himself, and which Arthur had not been
accustomed to see, or at least to look upon closely.
With the instinct of most birds of prey, it is the
custom of this creature, when gorged with food, to
assume some station of inaccessible security, and
there remain stationary and motionless for days
together, till the work of digestion has been accomplished,
and activity returns with the pressure of
appetite. Disturbed from such a state of repose,
one of these terrific birds had risen from the ravine
to which the species gives its name, and having
circled unwillingly round, with a ghastly scream
and a flagging wing, it had sunk down upon the
pinnacle of a crag, not four yards from the tree
in which Arthur held his precarious station.
Although still in some degree stupefied by torpor,
it seemed encouraged by the motionless state of
the young man to suppose him dead, or dying, and
sat there and gazed at him, without displaying
any of that apprehension which the fiercest animals
usually entertain from the vicinity of man.</p>

<p>As Arthur, endeavouring to shake off the incapacitating
effects of his panic fear, raised his eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
to look gradually and cautiously around, he encountered
those of the voracious and obscene bird,
whose head and neck denuded of feathers, her eyes
surrounded by an iris of an orange-tawny colour,
and a position more horizontal than erect, distinguished
her as much from the noble carriage and
graceful proportions of the eagle, as those of the
lion place him in the ranks of creation above the
gaunt, ravenous, grisly, yet dastard wolf.</p>

<p>As if arrested by a charm, the eyes of young
Philipson remained bent on this ill-omened and
ill-favoured bird, without his having the power to
remove them. The apprehension of dangers, ideal
as well as real, weighed upon his weakened mind,
disabled as it was by the circumstances of his situation.
The near approach of a creature, not more
loathsome to the human race than averse to come
within their reach, seemed as ominous as it was unusual.
Why did it gaze on him with such glaring
earnestness, projecting its disgusting form, as if
presently to alight upon his person? The foul
bird, was she the demon of the place to which her
name referred? and did she come to exult that an
intruder on her haunts seemed involved amid their
perils, with little hope or chance of deliverance?
Or was it a native vulture of the rocks, whose
sagacity foresaw that the rash traveller was soon
destined to become its victim? Could the creature,
whose senses are said to be so acute, argue
from circumstances the stranger's approaching
death, and wait, like a raven or hooded crow by a
dying sheep, for the earliest opportunity to commence
her ravenous banquet? Was he doomed to
feel its beak and talons before his heart's blood
should cease to beat? Had he already lost the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
dignity of humanity, the awe which the being
formed in the image of his Maker inspires into all
inferior creatures?</p>

<p>Apprehensions so painful served more than all
that reason could suggest to renew in some degree
the elasticity of the young man's mind. By waving
his handkerchief, using, however, the greatest
precaution in his movements, he succeeded in
scaring the vulture from his vicinity. It rose
from its resting-place, screaming harshly and dolefully,
and sailed on its expanded pinions to seek a
place of more undisturbed repose, while the adventurous
traveller felt a sensible pleasure at being
relieved of its disgusting presence.</p>

<p>With more collected ideas, the young man, who
could obtain, from his position, a partial view of
the platform he had left, endeavoured to testify
his safety to his father, by displaying, as high as
he could, the banner by which he had chased off
the vulture. Like them, too, he heard, but at a
less distance, the burst of the great Swiss horn,
which seemed to announce some near succour. He
replied by shouting and waving his flag, to direct
assistance to the spot where it was so much required;
and, recalling his faculties, which had
almost deserted him, he laboured mentally to
recover hope, and with hope the means and motive
for exertion.</p>

<p>A faithful Catholic, he eagerly recommended
himself in prayer to Our Lady of Einsiedlen, and,
making vows of propitiation, besought her intercession,
that he might be delivered from his dreadful
condition. "Or, gracious Lady!" he concluded
his orison, "if it is my doom to lose my life like
a hunted fox amidst this savage wilderness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
tottering crags, restore at least my natural sense of
patience and courage, and let not one who has
lived like a man, though a sinful one, meet death
like a timid hare!"</p>

<p>Having devoutly recommended himself to that
Protectress, of whom the legends of the Catholic
Church form a picture so amiable, Arthur, though
every nerve still shook with his late agitation,
and his heart throbbed with a violence that threatened
to suffocate him, turned his thoughts and
observation to the means of effecting his escape.
But, as he looked around him, he became more
and more sensible how much he was enervated by
the bodily injuries and the mental agony which he
had sustained during his late peril. He could
not, by any effort of which he was capable, fix his
giddy and bewildered eyes on the scene around
him;&mdash;they seemed to reel till the landscape
danced along with them, and a motley chaos of
thickets and tall cliffs, which interposed between
him and the ruinous Castle of Geierstein, mixed
and whirled round in such confusion, that nothing,
save the consciousness that such an idea was the
suggestion of partial insanity, prevented him from
throwing himself from the tree, as if to join the
wild dance to which his disturbed brain had given
motion.</p>

<p>"Heaven be my protection!" said the unfortunate
young man, closing his eyes, in hopes, by
abstracting himself from the terrors of his situation,
to compose his too active imagination, "my
senses are abandoning me!"</p>

<p>He became still more convinced that this was
the case, when a female voice, in a high-pitched
but eminently musical accent, was heard at no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
great distance, as if calling to him. He opened
his eyes once more, raised his head, and looked
towards the place whence the sounds seemed to
come, though far from being certain that they
existed saving in his own disordered imagination.
The vision which appeared had almost confirmed
him in the opinion that his mind was
unsettled, and his senses in no state to serve him
accurately.</p>

<p>Upon the very summit of a pyramidical rock,
that rose out of the depth of the valley, was seen
a female figure, so obscured by mist that only
the outline could be traced. The form, reflected
against the sky, appeared rather the undefined
lineaments of a spirit than of a mortal maiden;
for her person seemed as light, and scarcely more
opaque, than the thin cloud that surrounded her
pedestal. Arthur's first belief was, that the
Virgin had heard his vows, and had descended in
person to his rescue; and he was about to recite
his Ave Maria, when the voice again called to him
with the singular shrill modulation of the mountain
halloo, by which the natives of the Alps can
hold conference with each other from one mountain
ridge to another, across ravines of great depth
and width.</p>

<p>While he debated how to address this unexpected
apparition, it disappeared from the point
which it at first occupied, and presently after
became again visible, perched on the cliff out of
which projected the tree in which Arthur had
taken refuge. Her personal appearance, as well as
her dress, made it then apparent that she was a
maiden of these mountains, familiar with their
dangerous paths. He saw that a beautiful young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
woman stood before him, who regarded him with
a mixture of pity and wonder.</p>

<p>"Stranger," she at length said, "who are you,
and whence come you?"</p>

<p>"I am a stranger, maiden, as you justly term
me," answered the young man, raising himself as
well as he could. "I left Lucerne this morning,
with my father, and a guide. I parted with them
not three furlongs from hence. May it please you,
gentle maiden, to warn them of my safety, for I
know my father will be in despair upon my
account?"</p>

<p>"Willingly," said the maiden; "but I think
my uncle, or some one of my kinsmen, must have
already found them, and will prove faithful guides.
Can I not aid you? Are you wounded? Are you
hurt? We were alarmed by the fall of a rock&mdash;ay,
and yonder it lies, a mass of no ordinary size."</p>

<p>As the Swiss maiden spoke thus, she approached
so close to the verge of the precipice, and looked
with such indifference into the gulf, that the
sympathy which connects the actor and spectator
upon such occasions brought back the sickness
and vertigo from which Arthur had just recovered,
and he sank back into his former more recumbent
posture, with something like a faint groan.</p>

<p>"You are then ill?" said the maiden, who observed
him turn pale. "Where and what is the
harm you have received?"</p>

<p>"None, gentle maiden, saving some bruises of
little import; but my head turns, and my heart
grows sick, when I see you so near the verge of
the cliff."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" replied the Swiss maiden.
"Know, stranger, that I do not stand on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
uncle's hearth with more security than I have
stood upon precipices compared to which this is
a child's leap. You too, stranger, if, as I judge
from the traces, you have come along the edge of
the precipice which the earth-slide hath laid bare,
ought to be far beyond such weakness, since surely
you must be well entitled to call yourself a
cragsman."</p>

<p>"I might have called myself so half an hour
since," answered Arthur; "but I think I shall
hardly venture to assume the name in future."</p>

<p>"Be not downcast," said his kind adviser, "for
a passing qualm, which will at times cloud the
spirit and dazzle the eyesight of the bravest and
most experienced. Raise yourself upon the trunk
of the tree, and advance closer to the rock out of
which it grows. Observe the place well. It is
easy for you, when you have attained the lower
part of the projecting stem, to gain by one bold
step the solid rock upon which I stand, after
which there is no danger or difficulty worthy of
mention to a young man, whose limbs are whole,
and whose courage is active."</p>

<p>"My limbs are indeed sound," replied the
youth; "but I am ashamed to think how much my
courage is broken. Yet I will not disgrace the
interest you have taken in an unhappy wanderer,
by listening longer to the dastardly suggestions of
a feeling which till to-day has been a stranger to
my bosom."</p>

<p>The maiden looked on him anxiously, and with
much interest, as, raising himself cautiously, and
moving along the trunk of the tree, which lay
nearly horizontal from the rock, and seemed to
bend as he changed his posture, the youth at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
length stood upright, within what, on level
ground, had been but an extended stride to the
cliff on which the Swiss maiden stood. But instead
of being a step to be taken on the level and
firm earth, it was one which must cross a dark
abyss, at the bottom of which a torrent surged
and boiled with incredible fury. Arthur's knees
knocked against each other, his feet became of
lead, and seemed no longer at his command; and
he experienced, in a stronger degree than ever,
that unnerving influence, which those who have
been overwhelmed by it in a situation of like
peril never can forget, and which others, happily
strangers to its power, may have difficulty even in
comprehending.</p>

<p>The young woman discerned his emotion, and
foresaw its probable consequences. As the only
mode in her power to restore his confidence, she
sprang lightly from the rock to the stem of the
tree, on which she alighted with the ease and
security of a bird, and in the same instant back to
the cliff; and extending her hand to the stranger,
"My arm," she said, "is but a slight balustrade;
yet do but step forward with resolution, and you
will find it as secure as the battlement of Berne."
But shame now overcame terror so much, that
Arthur, declining assistance which he could not
have accepted without feeling lowered in his own
eyes, took heart of grace, and successfully achieved
the formidable step which placed him upon the
same cliff with his kind assistant.</p>

<p>To seize her hand and raise it to his lips, in
affectionate token of gratitude and respect, was
naturally the youth's first action; nor was it possible
for the maiden to have prevented him from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
doing so, without assuming a degree of prudery
foreign to her character, and occasioning a ceremonious
debate upon a matter of no great consequence,
where the scene of action was a rock
scarce five feet long by three in width, and which
looked down upon a torrent roaring some three
hundred feet below.

<p>Arthur Philipson and Anne of Geierstein, thus
placed together in a situation which brought them
into the closest possible contiguity, felt a slight
degree of embarrassment; the young man, doubtless,
from the fear of being judged a poltroon in
the eyes of the maiden by whom he had been
rescued, and the young woman, perhaps, in consequence
of the exertion she had made, or a sense
of being placed suddenly in a situation of such
proximity to the youth whose life she had probably
saved.</p>

<p>"And now, maiden," said Arthur, "I must
repair to my father. The life which I owe to
your assistance can scarce be called welcome to
me, unless I am permitted to hasten to his
rescue."</p>

<p>He was here interrupted by another bugle-blast,
which seemed to come from the quarter in which
the elder Philipson and his guide had been left by
their young and daring companion. Arthur looked
in that direction; but the platform, which he had
seen but imperfectly from the tree, when he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
perched in that place of refuge, was invisible from
the rock on which they now stood.</p>

<p>"It would cost me nothing to step back on
yonder root," said the young woman, "to spy from
thence whether I could see aught of your friends.
But I am convinced they are under safer guidance
than either yours or mine; for the horn announces
that my uncle, or some of my young kinsmen,
have reached them. They are by this time on
their way to the Geierstein, to which, with your
permission, I will become your guide; for you
may be assured that my uncle Arnold will not
allow you to pass farther to-day; and we shall but
lose time by endeavouring to find your friends,
who, situated where you say you left them, will
reach the Geierstein sooner than we shall. Follow
me, then, or I must suppose you weary of my
guidance."</p>

<p>"Sooner suppose me weary of the life which your
guidance has in all probability saved," replied
Arthur, and prepared to attend her; at the same
time taking a view of her dress and person, which
confirmed the satisfaction he had in following such
a conductor, and which we shall take the liberty
to detail somewhat more minutely than he could
do at that time.</p>

<p>An upper vest, neither so close as to display the
person, a habit forbidden by the sumptuary laws
of the canton, nor so loose as to be an incumbrance
in walking or climbing, covered a close tunic of a
different colour, and came down beneath the middle
of the leg, but suffered the ankle, in all its fine
proportions, to be completely visible. The foot
was defended by a sandal, the point of which was
turned upwards, and the crossings and knots of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the strings, which secured it on the front of the
leg, were garnished with silver rings. The upper
vest was gathered round the middle by a sash
of party-coloured silk, ornamented with twisted
threads of gold; while the tunic, open at the
throat, permitted the shape and exquisite whiteness
of a well-formed neck to be visible at the
collar, and for an inch or two beneath. The small
portion of the throat and bosom thus exposed was
even more brilliantly fair than was promised by
the countenance, which last bore some marks of
having been freely exposed to the sun and air, by no
means in a degree to diminish its beauty, but just
so far as to show that the maiden possessed the
health which is purchased by habits of rural exercise.
Her long fair hair fell down in a profusion
of curls on each side of a face, whose blue eyes,
lovely features, and dignified simplicity of expression
implied at once a character of gentleness
and of the self-relying resolution of a mind too
virtuous to suspect evil, and too noble to fear it.
Above these locks, beauty's natural and most
beseeming ornament&mdash;or rather, I should say,
amongst them&mdash;was placed the small bonnet,
which, from its size, little answered the purpose
of protecting the head, but served to exercise the
ingenuity of the fair wearer, who had not failed,
according to the prevailing custom of the mountain
maidens, to decorate the tiny cap with a
heron's feather, and the then unusual luxury of
a small and thin chain of gold, long enough to
encircle the cap four or five times, and having the
ends secured under a broad medal of the same
costly metal.</p>

<p>I have only to add, that the stature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
young person was something above the common
size, and that the whole contour of her form,
without being in the slightest degree masculine,
resembled that of Minerva, rather than the proud
beauties of Juno, or the yielding graces of Venus.
The noble brow, the well-formed and active limbs,
the firm and yet light step&mdash;above all, the total
absence of anything resembling the consciousness
of personal beauty, and the open and candid look,
which seemed desirous of knowing nothing that
was hidden, and conscious that she herself had
nothing to hide, were traits not unworthy of the
goddess of wisdom and of chastity.</p>

<p>The road which the young Englishman pursued,
under the guidance of this beautiful young woman,
was difficult and unequal, but could not be termed
dangerous, at least in comparison to those precipices
over which Arthur had recently passed. It
was, in fact, a continuation of the path which the
slip or slide of earth, so often mentioned, had
interrupted; and although it had sustained damage
in several places at the period of the same earthquake,
yet there were marks of these having been
already repaired in such a rude manner as made
the way sufficient for the necessary intercourse of
a people so indifferent as the Swiss to smooth or
level paths. The maiden also gave Arthur to understand,
that the present road took a circuit for
the purpose of gaining that on which he was lately
travelling, and that, if he and his companions had
turned off at the place where this new track united
with the old pathway, they would have escaped
the danger which had attended their keeping the
road by the verge of the precipice.</p>

<p>The path which they now pursued was rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
averted from the torrent, though still within hearing
of its sullen thunders, which seemed to increase
as they ascended parallel to its course, till suddenly
the road, turning short, and directing itself
straight upon the old castle, brought them within
sight of one of the most splendid and awful scenes
of that mountainous region.</p>

<p>The ancient tower of Geierstein, though neither
extensive nor distinguished by architectural ornament,
possessed an air of terrible dignity by its
position on the very verge of the opposite bank of
the torrent, which, just at the angle of the rock on
which the ruins are situated, falls sheer over a
cascade of nearly a hundred feet in height, and
then rushes down the defile, through a trough of
living rock, which perhaps its waves have been
deepening since time itself had a commencement.
Facing, and at the same time looking down upon
this eternal roar of waters, stood the old tower,
built so close to the verge of the precipice that the
buttresses with which the architect had strengthened
the foundation seemed a part of the solid
rock itself, and a continuation of its perpendicular
ascent. As usual throughout Europe in the feudal
times, the principal part of the building was a
massive square pile, the decayed summit of which
was rendered picturesque, by flanking turrets of
different sizes and heights, some round, some angular,
some ruinous, some tolerably entire, varying
the outline of the building as seen against the
stormy sky.</p>

<p>A projecting sallyport, descending by a flight of
steps from the tower, had in former times given
access to a bridge connecting the castle with that
side of the stream on which Arthur Philipson and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
his fair guide now stood. A single arch, or rather
one rib of an arch, consisting of single stones, still
remained, and spanned the river immediately in
front of the waterfall. In former times this arch
had served for the support of a wooden drawbridge,
of more convenient breadth, and of such
length and weight as must have been rather unmanageable,
had it not been lowered on some solid
resting-place. It is true, the device was attended
with this inconvenience, that even when the drawbridge
was up, there remained a possibility of
approaching the castle gate by means of this narrow
rib of stone. But as it was not above eighteen
inches broad, and could only admit the daring foe
who should traverse it to a doorway regularly
defended by gate and portcullis, and having flanking
turrets and projections, from which stones,
darts, melted lead, and scalding water might be
poured down on the soldiery who should venture to
approach Geierstein by this precarious access, the
possibility of such an attempt was not considered
as diminishing the security of the garrison.</p>

<p>In the time we treat of, the castle being entirely
ruined and dismantled, and the door, drawbridge,
and portcullis gone, the dilapidated gateway,
and the slender arch which connected the two
sides of the stream, were used as a means of
communication between the banks of the river, by
the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, whom habit
had familiarised with the dangerous nature of the
passage.</p>

<p>Arthur Philipson had, in the meantime, like a
good bow when new strung, regained the elasticity
of feeling and character which was natural to him.
It was not indeed with perfect composure that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
followed his guide, as she tripped lightly over the
narrow arch, composed of rugged stones, and rendered
wet and slippery with the perpetual drizzle
of the mist issuing from the neighbouring cascade.
Nor was it without apprehension that he found
himself performing this perilous feat in the neighbourhood
of the waterfall itself, whose deafening
roar he could not exclude from his ears, though he
took care not to turn his head towards its terrors,
lest his brain should again be dizzied by the
tumult of the waters as they shot forward from the
precipice above, and plunged themselves into what
seemed the fathomless gulf below. But notwithstanding
these feelings of agitation, the natural
shame to show cowardice where a beautiful young
female exhibited so much indifference, and the
desire to regain his character in the eyes of his
guide, prevented Arthur from again giving way to
the appalling feelings by which he had been overwhelmed
a short time before. Stepping firmly on,
yet cautiously supporting himself with his piked
staff, he traced the light footsteps of his guide
along the bridge of dread, and followed her through
the ruined sallyport, to which they ascended by
stairs which were equally dilapidated.</p>

<p>The gateway admitted them into a mass of
ruins, formerly a sort of courtyard to the donjon,
which rose in gloomy dignity above the wreck of
what had been works destined for external defence,
or buildings for internal accommodation. They
quickly passed through these ruins, over which
vegetation had thrown a wild mantle of ivy, and
other creeping shrubs, and issued from them
through the main gate of the castle into one of
those spots in which Nature often embosoms her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
sweetest charms, in the midst of districts chiefly
characterised by waste and desolation.</p>

<p>The castle in this aspect also rose considerably
above the neighbouring ground, but the elevation
of the site, which towards the torrent was an
abrupt rock, was on this side a steep eminence,
which had been scarped like a modern glacis, to
render the building more secure. It was now
covered with young trees and bushes, out of which
the tower itself seemed to rise in ruined dignity.
Beyond this hanging thicket the view was of
a very different character. A piece of ground,
amounting to more than a hundred acres, seemed
scooped out of the rocks and mountains, which,
retaining the same savage character with the tract
in which the travellers had been that morning
bewildered, enclosed, and as it were defended, a
limited space of a mild and fertile character. The
surface of this little domain was considerably
varied, but its general aspect was a gentle slope
to the south-west.</p>

<p>The principal object which it presented was a
large house composed of huge logs, without any pretence
to form or symmetry, but indicating, by the
smoke which arose from it, as well as the extent
of the neighbouring offices, and the improved and
cultivated character of the fields around, that it was
the abode, not of splendour certainly, but of ease
and competence. An orchard of thriving fruit-trees
extended to the southward of the dwelling. Groves
of walnut and chestnut grew in stately array, and
even a vineyard, of three or four acres, showed
that the cultivation of the grape was understood
and practised. It is now universal in Switzerland,
but was, in those early days, almost exclusively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
confined to a few more fortunate proprietors,
who had the rare advantage of uniting intelligence
with opulent, or at least easy, circumstances.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i087" id="i087"></a>
   <img src="images/i-087.jpg" width="366" height="550" alt="" />
   <p class="caption">GEIERSTEIN.<br />
   <span class="s08">Drawn and Etched by R de los Rios.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There were fair ranges of pasture-fields, into
which the fine race of cattle which constitute the
pride and wealth of the Swiss mountaineers had
been brought down from the more Alpine grazings
where they had fed during the summer, to be near
shelter and protection when the autumnal storms
might be expected. On some selected spots, the
lambs of the last season fed in plenty and security,
and in others, huge trees, the natural growth of
the soil, were suffered to remain, from motives of
convenience probably, that they might be at hand
when timber was required for domestic use, but
giving, at the same time, a woodland character
to a scene otherwise agricultural. Through this
mountain-paradise the course of a small brook
might be traced, now showing itself to the sun,
which had by this time dispelled the fogs, now
intimating its course, by its gently sloping banks,
clothed in some places with lofty trees, or concealing
itself under thickets of hawthorn and nut
bushes. This stream, by a devious and gentle
course, which seemed to indicate a reluctance to
leave this quiet region, found its way at length
out of the sequestered domain, and, like a youth
hurrying from the gay and tranquil sports of boyhood
into the wild career of active life, finally
united itself with the boisterous torrent, which,
breaking down tumultuously from the mountains,
shook the ancient Tower of Geierstein as it rolled
down the adjacent rock, and then rushed howling
through the defile in which our youthful traveller
had well-nigh lost his life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Eager as the younger Philipson was to rejoin his
father, he could not help pausing for a moment to
wonder how so much beauty should be found amid
such scenes of horror, and to look back on the
Tower of Geierstein, and on the huge cliff from
which it derived its name, as if to ascertain, by
the sight of these distinguished landmarks, that
he was actually in the neighbourhood of the savage
wild where he had encountered so much danger
and terror. Yet so narrow were the limits of this
cultivated farm, that it hardly required such a
retrospect to satisfy the spectator that the spot
susceptible of human industry, and on which it
seemed that a considerable degree of labour had
been bestowed, bore a very small proportion to the
wilderness in which it was situated. It was on
all sides surrounded by lofty hills, in some places
rising into walls of rock, in others clothed with
dark and savage forests of the pine and the larch,
of primeval antiquity. Above these, from the
eminence on which the tower was situated, could
be seen the almost rosy hue in which an immense
glacier threw back the sun; and still higher over
the frozen surface of that icy sea arose, in silent
dignity, the pale peaks of those countless mountains,
on which the snow eternally rests.</p>

<p>What we have taken some time to describe,
occupied young Philipson only for one or two
hurried minutes; for on a sloping lawn, which
was in front of the farm-house, as the mansion
might properly be styled, he saw five or six persons,
the foremost of whom, from his gait, his dress,
and the form of his cap, he could easily distinguish
as the parent whom he hardly expected at
one time to have again beheld.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>He followed, therefore, his conductress with a
glad step, as she led the way down the steep
ascent on which the ruined tower was situated.
They approached the group whom Arthur had
noticed, the foremost of which was his father, who
hastily came forward to meet him, in company
with another person, of advanced age, and stature
well-nigh gigantic, and who, from his simple yet
majestic bearing, seemed the worthy countryman
of William Tell, Stauffacher, Winkelried, and
other Swiss worthies, whose stout hearts and
hardy arms had, in the preceding age, vindicated
against countless hosts their personal liberty, and
the independence of their country.</p>

<p>With a natural courtesy, as if to spare the
father and son many witnesses to a meeting which
must be attended with emotion, the Landamman
himself, in walking forward with the elder Philipson,
signed to those by whom he was attended, all
of whom seemed young men, to remain behind.
They remained accordingly, examining, as it
seemed, the guide Antonio, upon the adventures
of the strangers. Anne, the conductress of Arthur
Philipson, had but time to say to him, "Yonder
old man is my uncle, Arnold Biederman, and these
young men are my kinsmen," when the former,
with the elder traveller, were close before them.
The Landamman, with the same propriety of feeling
which he had before displayed, signed to his
niece to move a little aside; yet while requiring
from her an account of her morning's expedition,
he watched the interview of the father and son
with as much curiosity as his natural sense of complaisance
permitted him to testify. It was of a
character different from what he had expected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>We have already described the elder Philipson
as a father devotedly attached to his son, ready to
rush on death when he had expected to lose him,
and equally overjoyed at heart, doubtless, to see
him again restored to his affections. It might
have been therefore expected that the father and
son would have rushed into each other's arms,
and such probably was the scene which Arnold
Biederman expected to have witnessed.</p>

<p>But the English traveller, in common with
many of his countrymen, covered keen and quick
feelings with much appearance of coldness and
reserve, and thought it a weakness to give unlimited
sway even to the influence of the most
amiable and most natural emotions. Eminently
handsome in youth, his countenance, still fine in
his more advanced years, had an expression which
intimated an unwillingness either to yield to
passion or encourage confidence. His pace, when
he first beheld his son, had been quickened by the
natural wish to meet him; but he slackened it as
they drew near to each other, and when they met,
said in a tone rather of censure and admonition
than affection,&mdash;"Arthur, may the Saints forgive
the pain thou hast this day given me."</p>

<p>"Amen," said the youth. "I must need pardon
since I have given you pain. Believe, however,
that I acted for the best."</p>

<p>"It is well, Arthur, that in acting for the best,
according to your forward will, you have not encountered
the worst."</p>

<p>"That I have not," answered the son, with the
same devoted and patient submission, "is owing to
this maiden," pointing to Anne, who stood at a
few paces' distance, desirous perhaps of avoiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
to witness the reproof of the father, which might
seem to her rather ill-timed and unreasonable.</p>

<p>"To the maiden my thanks shall be rendered,"
said his father, "when I can study how to pay
them in an adequate manner; but is it well or
comely, think you, that you should receive from
a maiden the succour which it is your duty as a
man to extend to the weaker sex?"</p>

<p>Arthur held down his head and blushed deeply,
while Arnold Biederman, sympathising with his
feelings, stepped forward and mingled in the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Never be abashed, my young guest, that you
have been indebted for aught of counsel or assistance
to a maiden of Unterwalden. Know that the
freedom of their country owes no less to the firmness
and wisdom of her daughters than to that of
her sons.&mdash;And you, my elder guest, who have,
I judge, seen many years and various lands, must
have often known examples how the strong are
saved by the help of the weak, the proud by the
aid of the humble."</p>

<p>"I have at least learned," said the Englishman,
"to debate no point unnecessarily with the host
who has kindly harboured me;" and after one
glance at his son, which seemed to kindle with
the fondest affection, he resumed, as the party
turned back towards the house, a conversation
which he had been maintaining with his new
acquaintance before Arthur and the maiden had
joined them.</p>

<p>Arthur had in the meantime an opportunity of
observing the figure and features of their Swiss
landlord, which, I have already hinted, exhibited
a primeval simplicity mixed with a certain rude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
dignity, arising out of its masculine and unaffected
character. The dress did not greatly differ in
form from the habit of the female which we have
described. It consisted of an upper frock, shaped
like the modern shirt, and only open at the bosom,
worn above a tunic or under doublet. But the
man's vest was considerably shorter in the skirts,
which did not come lower down than the kilt of
the Scottish Highlander; a species of boots or
buskins rose above the knee, and the person was
thus entirely clothed. A bonnet made of the fur
of the marten, and garnished with a silver medal,
was the only part of the dress which displayed
anything like ornament; the broad belt which
gathered the garment together was of buff leather,
secured by a large brass buckle.</p>

<p>But the figure of him who wore this homely
attire, which seemed almost wholly composed of
the fleeces of the mountain sheep and the spoils
of animals of the chase, would have commanded
respect wherever the wearer had presented himself,
especially in those warlike days, when men
were judged of according to the promising or
unpromising qualities of their thews and sinews.
To those who looked at Arnold Biederman from
this point of view, he displayed the size and form,
the broad shoulders and prominent muscles, of
a Hercules. But to such as looked rather at his
countenance, the steady sagacious features, open
front, large blue eyes, and deliberate resolution
which it expressed, more resembled the character
of the fabled King of Gods and Men. He was
attended by several sons and relatives, young men,
among whom he walked, receiving, as his undeniable
due, respect and obedience, similar to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
which a herd of deer are observed to render to the
monarch stag.</p>

<p>While Arnold Biederman walked and spoke
with the elder stranger, the young men seemed
closely to scrutinise Arthur, and occasionally
interrogated in whispers their relation Anne,
receiving from her brief and impatient answers,
which rather excited than appeased the vein of
merriment in which the mountaineers indulged,
very much, as it seemed to the young Englishman,
at the expense of their guest. To feel himself
exposed to derision was not softened by the reflection,
that in such a society it would probably be
attached to all who could not tread on the edge of
a precipice with a step as firm and undismayed as
if they walked the street of a city. However unreasonable
ridicule may be, it is always unpleasing
to be subjected to it, but more particularly is it
distressing to a young man, where beauty is a
listener. It was some consolation to Arthur that
he thought the maiden certainly did not enjoy the
jest, and seemed by word and look to reprove the
rudeness of her companions; but this he feared
was only from a sense of humanity.</p>

<p>"She, too, must despise me," he thought,
"though civility, unknown to these ill-taught
boors, has enabled her to conceal contempt under
the guise of pity. She can but judge of me from
that which she has seen&mdash;if she could know me
better" (such was his proud thought), "she might
perhaps rank me more highly."</p>

<p>As the travellers entered the habitation of
Arnold Biederman, they found preparations made
in a large apartment, which served the purpose of
general accommodation, for a homely but plentiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
meal. A glance round the walls showed the implements
of agriculture and the chase; but the
eyes of the elder Philipson rested upon a leathern
corselet, a long heavy halberd, and a two-handed
sword, which were displayed as a sort of trophy.
Near these, but covered with dust, unfurbished
and neglected, hung a helmet, with a visor, such
as was used by knights and men-at-arms. The
golden garland, or coronal twisted around it,
though sorely tarnished, indicated noble birth and
rank; and the crest, which was a vulture of the
species which gave name to the old castle and its
adjacent cliff, suggested various conjectures to the
English guest, who, acquainted in a great measure
with the history of the Swiss revolution, made
little doubt that in this relic he saw some trophy
of the ancient warfare between the inhabitants of
these mountains, and the feudal lord to whom
they had of yore appertained.</p>

<p>A summons to the hospitable board disturbed
the train of the English merchant's reflections;
and a large company, comprising the whole inhabitants
of every description that lived under
Biederman's roof, sat down to a plentiful repast
of goat's flesh, fish, preparations of milk of various
kinds, cheese, and, for the upper mess, the venison
of a young chamois. The Landamman himself did
the honours of the table with great kindness and
simplicity, and urged the strangers to show, by
their appetite, that they thought themselves as
welcome as he desired to make them. During the
repast, he carried on a conversation with his elder
guest, while the younger people at table, as well
as the menials, ate in modesty and silence. Ere
the dinner was finished, a figure crossed on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
outside of the large window which lighted the
eating-hall, the sight of which seemed to occasion
a lively sensation amongst such as observed it.</p>

<p>"Who passed?" said old Biederman to those
seated opposite to the window.</p>

<p>"It is our cousin, Rudolph of Donnerhugel,"
answered one of Arnold's sons eagerly.</p>

<p>The annunciation seemed to give great pleasure to
the younger part of the company, especially the
sons of the Landamman; while the head of the
family only said with a grave, calm voice,&mdash;"Your
kinsman is welcome&mdash;tell him so, and let
him come hither."</p>

<p>Two or three arose for this purpose, as if there
had been a contention among them who should do
the honours of the house to the new guest. He
entered presently&mdash;a young man, unusually tall,
well-proportioned and active, with a quantity of
dark-brown locks curling around his face, together
with mustaches of the same, or rather a still
darker hue. His cap was small considering the
quantity of his thickly clustering hair, and rather
might be said to hang upon one side of his head
than to cover it. His clothes were of the same
form and general fashion as those of Arnold, but
made of much finer cloth, the manufacture of the
German loom, and ornamented in a rich and fanciful
manner. One sleeve of his vest was dark
green, curiously laced and embroidered with devices
in silver, while the rest of the garment was
scarlet. His sash was twisted and netted with
gold, and besides answering the purpose of a belt,
by securing the upper garment round his waist,
sustained a silver-hilted poniard. His finery was
completed by boots, the tips of which were so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
as to turn upwards with a peak, after a prevailing
fashion in the Middle Ages. A golden chain hung
round his neck, and sustained a large medallion of
the same metal.</p>

<p>This young gallant was instantly surrounded by
the race of Biederman, among whom he appeared
to be considered as the model upon which the
Swiss youth ought to build themselves, and whose
gait, opinions, dress, and manners all ought to
follow who would keep pace with the fashion of
the day, in which he reigned an acknowledged and
unrivalled example.</p>

<p>By two persons in the company, however, it
seemed to Arthur Philipson that this young man
was received with less distinguished marks of
regard than those with which he was hailed by
the general voice of the youths present. Arnold
Biederman himself was at least no way warm
in welcoming the young Bernese, for such was
Rudolph's country. The young man drew from
his bosom a sealed packet, which he delivered to
the Landamman with demonstrations of great respect,
and seemed to expect that Arnold, when he
had broken the seal and perused the contents,
would say something to him on the subject. But
the patriarch only bade him be seated, and partake
of their meal, and Rudolph found a place accordingly
next to Anne of Geierstein, which was
yielded to him by one of the sons of Arnold with
ready courtesy.</p>

<p>It seemed also to the observant young Englishman,
that the new comer was received with
marked coldness by the maiden, to whom he appeared
eager and solicitous to pay his compliments,
by whose side he had contrived to seat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
himself at the well-furnished board, and to whom
he seemed more anxious to recommend himself,
than to partake of the food which it offered. He
observed the gallant whisper her, and look towards
him. Anne gave a very brief reply, but one of
the young Biedermans, who sat on his other hand,
was probably more communicative, as the youths
both laughed, and the maiden again seemed disconcerted,
and blushed with displeasure.</p>

<p>"Had I either of these sons of the mountain,"
thought young Philipson, "upon six yards of level
greensward, if there be so much flat ground in this
country, methinks I were more likely to spoil
their mirth than to furnish food for it. It is as
marvellous to see such conceited boors under the
same roof with so courteous and amiable a damsel,
as it would be to see one of their shaggy bears
dance a rigadoon with a maiden like the daughter
of our host. Well, I need not concern myself
more than I can help about her beauty or their
breeding, since morning will separate me from
them for ever."</p>

<p>As these reflections passed through the young
guest's mind, the father of the family called for
a cup of wine, and having required the two
strangers to pledge him in a maple cup of considerable
size, he sent a similar goblet to Rudolph
Donnerhugel. "Yet you," he said, "kinsman,
are used to more highly flavoured wine than the
half-ripened grapes of Geierstein can supply.&mdash;Would
you think it, Sir Merchant," he continued,
addressing Philipson, "there are burghers of Berne
who send for wine for their own drinking both to
France and Germany?"</p>

<p>"My kinsman disapproves of that," replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Rudolph; "yet every place is not blessed with
vineyards like Geierstein, which produces all that
heart and eye can desire." This was said with a
glance at his fair companion, who did not appear
to take the compliment, while the envoy of Berne
proceeded: "But our wealthier burghers, having
some superfluous crowns, think it no extravagance
to barter them for a goblet of better wine than our
own mountains can produce. But we will be
more frugal when we have at our disposal tuns of
the wine of Burgundy, for the mere trouble of
transporting them."</p>

<p>"How mean you by that, cousin Rudolph?"
said Arnold Biederman.</p>

<p>"Methinks, respected kinsman," answered the
Bernese, "your letters must have told you that our
Diet is likely to declare war against Burgundy?"</p>

<p>"Ah! And you know, then, the contents of my
letters?" said Arnold; "another mark how times
are changed at Berne, and with the Diet of Switzerland.
When did all her grey-haired statesmen
die, that our allies should have brought beardless
boys into their councils?"</p>

<p>"The Senate of Berne, and the Diet of the Confederacy,"
said the young man, partly abashed,
partly in vindication of what he had before spoken,
"allow the young men to know their purposes,
since it is they by whom they must be executed.
The head which thinks may well confide in the
hand that strikes."</p>

<p>"Not till the moment of dealing the blow,
young man," said Arnold Biederman, sternly.
"What kind of counsellor is he who talks loosely
the secrets of state affairs before women and
strangers? Go, Rudolph, and all of ye, and try
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
by manly exercises which is best fitted to serve
your country, rather than give your judgment upon
her measures.&mdash;Hold, young man," he continued,
addressing Arthur, who had arisen, "this does not
apply to you, who are unused to mountain travel,
and require rest after it."</p>

<p>"Under your favour, sir, not so," said the elder
stranger. "We hold, in England, that the best
refreshment after we have been exhausted by one
species of exercise is to betake ourselves to another;
as riding, for example, affords more relief to one
fatigued by walking, than a bed of down would.
So, if your young men will permit, my son will
join their exercises."</p>

<p>"He will find them rough playmates," answered
the Switzer; "but be it at your pleasure."</p>

<p>The young men went out accordingly to the open
lawn in front of the house. Anne of Geierstein,
and some females of the household, sat down on a
bank to judge which performed best, and shouts,
loud laughing, and all that announces the riot
of juvenile spirits occupied by manly sports, was
soon after heard by the two seniors, as they sat
together in the hall. The master of the house
resumed the wine-flask, and, having filled the cup
of his guest, poured the remainder into his own.</p>

<p>"At an age, worthy stranger," he said, "when
the blood grows colder, and the feelings heavier,
a moderate cup of wine brings back light thoughts,
and makes the limbs supple. Yet, I almost wish
that Noah had never planted the grape, when of
late years I have seen with my own eyes my
countrymen swill wine like very Germans, till
they were like gorged swine, incapable of sense,
thought, or motion."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a vice," said the Englishman, "which I
have observed gains ground in your country, where
within a century I have heard it was totally
unknown."</p>

<p>"It was so," said the Swiss, "for wine was
seldom made at home, and never imported from
abroad; for indeed none possessed the means of
purchasing that, or aught else, which our valleys
produce not. But our wars and our victories have
gained us wealth as well as fame; and in the poor
thoughts of one Switzer, at least, we had been
better without both, had we not also gained liberty
by the same exertion. It is something, however,
that commerce may occasionally send into our
remote mountains a sensible visitor like yourself,
worthy guest, whose discourse shows him to be a
man of sagacity and discernment; for though I love
not the increasing taste for trinkets and gewgaws
which you merchants introduce, yet I acknowledge
that we simple mountaineers learn from men like
you more of the world around us, than we could
acquire by our own exertions. You are bound,
you say, to Bâle, and thence to the Duke of
Burgundy's leaguer?"</p>

<p>"I am so, my worthy host," said the merchant&mdash;"that
is, providing I can perform my journey
with safety."</p>

<p>"Your safety, good friend, may be assured, if
you list to tarry for two or three days; for in that
space I shall myself take the journey, and with
such an escort as will prevent any risk of danger.
You will find in me a sure and faithful guide, and
I shall learn from you much of other countries,
which it concerns me to know better than I do.
Is it a bargain?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"The proposal is too much to my advantage to
be refused," said the Englishman; "but may I
ask the purpose of your journey?"</p>

<p>"I chid yonder boy but now," answered Biederman,
"for speaking on public affairs without
reflection, and before the whole family; but our
tidings and my errand need not be concealed from
a considerate person like you, who must indeed
soon learn it from public rumour. You know
doubtless the mutual hatred which subsists between
Louis XI. of France and Charles of Burgundy,
whom men call the Bold; and having seen
these countries, as I understand from your former
discourse, you are probably well aware of the
various contending interests, which, besides the
personal hatred of the sovereigns, make them irreconcilable
enemies. Now Louis, whom the world
cannot match for craft and subtlety, is using all
his influence, by distributions of large sums
amongst some of the counsellors of our neighbours
of Berne, by pouring treasures into the exchequer
of that state itself, by holding out the bait of
emolument to the old men, and encouraging the
violence of the young, to urge the Bernese into a
war with the Duke. Charles, on the other hand,
is acting, as he frequently does, exactly as Louis
could have wished. Our neighbours and allies of
Berne do not, like us of the Forest Cantons, confine
themselves to pasture or agriculture, but carry on
considerable commerce, which the Duke of Burgundy
has in various instances interrupted, by
the exactions and violence of his officers in the
frontier towns, as is doubtless well known to you."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably," answered the merchant;
"they are universally regarded as vexatious."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"You will not then be surprised, that, solicited
by the one sovereign, and aggrieved by the other,
proud of past victories, and ambitious of additional
power, Berne and the City Cantons of our confederacy,
whose representatives, from their superior
wealth and better education, have more to say
in our Diet than we of the Forests, should be bent
upon war, from which it has hitherto happened
that the Republic has always derived victory,
wealth, and increase of territory."</p>

<p>"Ay, worthy host, and of glory," said Philipson,
interrupting him with some enthusiasm; "I
wonder not that the brave youths of your states
are willing to thrust themselves upon new wars,
since their past victories have been so brilliant
and so far-famed."</p>

<p>"You are no wise merchant, kind guest," answered
the host, "if you regard success in former
desperate undertakings as an encouragement to
future rashness. Let us make a better use of past
victories. When we fought for our liberties God
blessed our arms; but will He do so if we fight
either for aggrandisement or for the gold of
France?"</p>

<p>"Your doubt is just," said the merchant, more
sedately; "but suppose you draw the sword to put
an end to the vexatious exactions of Burgundy?"</p>

<p>"Hear me, good friend," answered the Switzer;
"it may be that we of the Forest Cantons think
too little of those matters of trade, which so much
engross the attention of the burghers of Berne.
Yet we will not desert our neighbours and allies in
a just quarrel; and it is well-nigh settled that a
deputation shall be sent to the Duke of Burgundy
to request redress. In this embassy the General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Diet now assembled at Berne have requested that
I should take some share; and hence the journey
in which I propose that you should accompany
me."</p>

<p>"It will be much to my satisfaction to travel in
your company, worthy host," said the Englishman.
"But, as I am a true man, methinks your port and
figure resemble an envoy of defiance rather than a
messenger of peace."</p>

<p>"And I too might say," replied the Switzer,
"that your language and sentiments, my honoured
guest, rather belong to the sword than the measuring-wand."</p>

<p>"I was bred to the sword, worthy sir, before I
took the cloth-yard in my hand," replied Philipson,
smiling, "and it may be I am still more partial
to my old trade than wisdom would altogether
recommend."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Arnold; "but then you
fought most likely under your country's banners
against a foreign and national enemy; and in that
case I will admit that war has something in it
which elevates the heart above the due sense it
should entertain of the calamity inflicted and endured
by God's creatures on each side. But the
warfare in which I was engaged had no such gilding.
It was the miserable war of Zurich [<a href="#ednote_c" name="enanchor_c" id="enanchor_c" ><i>c</i></a>], where
Switzers levelled their pikes against the bosoms of
their own countrymen; and quarter was asked and
refused in the same kindly mountain language.
From such remembrances your warlike recollections
are probably free."</p>

<p>The merchant hung down his head and pressed
his forehead with his hand, as one to whom the
most painful thoughts were suddenly recalled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas!" he said, "I deserve to feel the pain
which your words inflict. What nation can know
the woes of England that has not felt them&mdash;what
eye can estimate them which has not seen a
land torn and bleeding with the strife of two
desperate factions, battles fought in every province,
plains heaped with slain, and scaffolds
drenched in blood! Even in your quiet valleys,
methinks, you may have heard of the Civil Wars
of England?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed bethink me," said the Switzer,
"that England had lost her possessions in France
during many years of bloody internal wars concerning
the colour of a rose&mdash;was it not?&mdash;But
these are ended."</p>

<p>"For the present," answered Philipson, "it
would seem so."</p>

<p>As he spoke, there was a knock at the door; the
master of the house said, "Come in!" the door
opened, and, with the reverence which was expected
from young persons towards their elders in
those pastoral regions, the fine form of Anne of
Geierstein presented itself.

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>And now the well-known bow the master bore,</p>
<p>Turn'd on all sides, and view'd it o'er and o'er;</p>
<p>Whilst some deriding, "How he turns the bow!</p>
<p>Some other like it sure the man must know:</p>
<p>Or else would copy&mdash;or in bows he deals;</p>
<p>Perhaps he makes them, or perhaps he steals."</p>

<p class="i16"><span class="smcap">Pope's</span> <i>Homer's Odyssey</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The fair maiden approached with the half-bashful
half-important look which sits so well on a young
housekeeper, when she is at once proud and
ashamed of the matronly duties she is called upon
to discharge, and whispered something in her
uncle's ear.</p>

<p>"And could not the idle-pated boys have brought
their own errand&mdash;what is it they want that they
cannot ask themselves, but must send thee to beg
it for them? Had it been anything reasonable, I
should have heard it dinned into my ears by forty
voices, so modest are our Swiss youths become
nowadays." She stooped forward, and again whispered
in his ear, as he fondly stroked her curling
tresses with his ample hand, and replied, "The
bow of Buttisholz, my dear? Why, the youths
surely are not grown stronger since last year, when
none of them could bend it? But yonder it hangs
with its three arrows. Who is the wise champion
that is challenger at a game where he is sure to
be foiled?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>"It is this gentleman's son, sir," said the
maiden, "who, not being able to contend with my
cousins in running, leaping, hurling the bar, or
pitching the stone, has challenged them to ride, or
to shoot with the English long-bow."</p>

<p>"To ride," said the venerable Swiss, "were difficult
where there are no horses, and no level ground
to career upon if there were. But an English bow
he shall have, since we happen to possess one.
Take it to the young men, my niece, with the
three arrows, and say to them from me, that he
who bends it will do more than William Tell, or
the renowned Stauffacher, could have done."</p>

<p>As the maiden went to take the weapon from
the place where it hung amid the group of arms
which Philipson had formerly remarked, the English
merchant observed, "that were the minstrels
of his land to assign her occupation, so fair a
maiden should be bow-bearer to none but the little
blind god Cupid."</p>

<p>"I will have nothing of the blind god Cupid,"
said Arnold, hastily, yet half laughing at the
same time; "we have been deafened with the
foolery of minstrels and strolling minnesingers,
ever since the wandering knaves have found there
were pence to be gathered among us. A Swiss
maiden should only sing Albert Ischudi's ballads,
or the merry lay of the going out and
return of the cows to and from the mountain
pastures."</p>

<p>While he spoke, the damsel had selected from the
arms a bow of extraordinary strength, considerably
above six feet in length, with three shafts of a
cloth-yard long. Philipson asked to look at the
weapons, and examined them closely. "It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
tough piece of yew," he said. "I should know it,
since I have dealt in such commodities in my time;
but when I was of Arthur's age, I could have bent
it as easily as a boy bends a willow."</p>

<p>"We are too old to boast like boys," said Arnold
Biederman, with something of a reproving glance
at his companion. "Carry the bow to thy kinsmen,
Anne, and let him who can bend it say he
beat Arnold Biederman." As he spoke, he turned
his eyes on the spare yet muscular figure of the
Englishman, then again glanced down on his own
stately person.</p>

<p>"You must remember, good my host," said
Philipson, "that weapons are wielded not by
strength, but by art and sleight of hand. What
most I wonder at, is to see in this place a bow
made by Matthew of Doncaster, a bowyer who
lived at least a hundred years ago, remarkable for
the great toughness and strength of the weapons
which he made, and which are now become somewhat
unmanageable, even by an English yeoman."</p>

<p>"How are you assured of the maker's name,
worthy guest?" replied the Swiss.</p>

<p>"By old Matthew's mark," answered the Englishman,
"and his initials cut upon the bow. I
wonder not a little to find such a weapon here,
and in such good preservation."</p>

<p>"It has been regularly waxed, oiled, and kept
in good order," said the Landamman, "being preserved
as a trophy of a memorable day. It would
but grieve you to recount its early history, since
it was taken in a day fatal to your country."</p>

<p>"My country," said the Englishman, composedly,
"has gained so many victories, that her
children may well afford to hear of a single defeat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
But I knew not that the English ever warred in
Switzerland."</p>

<p>"Not precisely as a nation," answered Biederman;
"but it was in my grandsire's days, that
a large body of roving soldiers, composed of men
from almost all countries, but especially Englishmen,
Normans, and Gascons, poured down on the
Argau, and the districts adjacent. They were headed
by a great warrior called Ingelram de Couci, who pretended
some claims upon the Duke of Austria; to
satisfy which, he ravaged indifferently the Austrian
territory and that of our Confederacy. His soldiers
were hired warriors&mdash;Free Companions they called
themselves&mdash;that seemed to belong to no country,
and were as brave in the fight as they were cruel
in their depredations. Some pause in the constant
wars betwixt France and England had deprived
many of those bands of their ordinary employment,
and battle being their element, they came
to seek it among our valleys. The air seemed on
fire with the blaze of their armour, and the very
sun was darkened at the flight of their arrows.
They did us much evil, and we sustained the loss
of more than one battle. But we met them at
Buttisholz, and mingled the blood of many a rider
(noble, as they were called and esteemed) with
that of their horses. The huge mound that covers
the bones of man and steed is still called the
English barrow."</p>

<p>Philipson was silent for a minute or two, and
then replied, "Then let them sleep in peace. If
they did wrong, they paid for it with their lives;
and that is all the ransom that mortal man can
render for his transgressions.&mdash;Heaven pardon
their souls!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"Amen," replied the Landamman, "and those
of all brave men!&mdash;My grandsire was at the
battle, and was held to have demeaned himself
like a good soldier; and this bow has been ever
since carefully preserved in our family. There is
a prophecy about it, but I hold it not worthy of
remark."</p>

<p>Philipson was about to inquire further, but
was interrupted by a loud cry of surprise and
astonishment from without.</p>

<p>"I must out," said Biederman, "and see what
these wild lads are doing. It is not now as formerly
in this land, when the young dared not
judge for themselves, till the old man's voice had
been heard."</p>

<p>He went forth from the lodge, followed by his
guest. The company who had witnessed the
games were all talking, shouting, and disputing
in the same breath; while Arthur Philipson stood
a little apart from the rest, leaning on the unbent
bow with apparent indifference. At the sight of
the Landamman all were silent.</p>

<p>"What means this unwonted clamour?" he
said, raising a voice to which all were accustomed
to listen with reverence.&mdash;"Rudiger," addressing
the eldest of his sons, "has the young stranger
bent the bow?"</p>

<p>"He has, father," said Rudiger; "and he has
hit the mark. Three such shots were never shot
by William Tell."</p>

<p>"It was chance&mdash;pure chance," said the young
Swiss from Berne. "No human skill could have
done it, much less a puny lad, baffled in all besides
that he attempted among us."</p>

<p>"But what <i>has</i> been done?" said the Landamman.&mdash;"Nay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
speak not all at once!&mdash;Anne of
Geierstein, thou hast more sense and breeding than
these boys&mdash;tell me how the game has gone."</p>

<p>The maiden seemed a little confused at this
appeal, but answered with a composed and downcast
look&mdash;</p>

<p>"The mark was, as usual, a pigeon to a pole.
All the young men, except the stranger, had practised
at it with the cross-bow and long-bow, without
hitting it. When I brought out the bow of
Buttisholz, I offered it first to my kinsmen. None
would accept of it, saying, respected uncle, that
a task too great for you must be far too difficult
for them."</p>

<p>"They said well," answered Arnold Biederman;
"and the stranger, did he string the bow?"</p>

<p>"He did, my uncle, but first he wrote something
on a piece of paper, and placed it in my hands."</p>

<p>"And did he shoot and hit the mark?" continued
the surprised Switzer.</p>

<p>"He first," said the maiden, "removed the pole
a hundred yards farther than the post where it
stood."</p>

<p>"Singular!" said the Landamman, "that is
double the usual distance."</p>

<p>"He then drew the bow," continued the maiden,
"and shot off, one after another, with incredible
rapidity, the three arrows which he had stuck into
his belt. The first cleft the pole, the second cut
the string, the third killed the poor bird as it rose
into the air."</p>

<p>"By St. Mary of Einsiedlen," said the old man,
looking up in amaze, "if your eyes really saw
this, they saw such archery as was never before
witnessed in the Forest States!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"I say nay to that, my revered kinsman,"
replied Rudolph Donnerhugel, whose vexation was
apparent; "it was mere chance, if not illusion or
witchery."</p>

<p>"What say'st thou of it thyself, Arthur," said
his father, half smiling. "Was thy success by
chance or skill?"</p>

<p>"My father," said the young man, "I need not
tell you that I have done but an ordinary feat for
an English bowman. Nor do I speak to gratify
that misproud and ignorant young man. But to
our worthy host and his family, I make answer.
This youth charges me with having deluded men's
eyes, or hit the mark by chance. For illusion,
yonder is the pierced pole, the severed string, and
the slain bird, they will endure sight and handling;
and, besides, if that fair maiden will open
the note which I put into her hand, she will
find evidence to assure you, that even before I
drew the bow, I had fixed upon the three marks
which I designed to aim at."</p>

<p>"Produce the scroll, good niece," said her uncle,
"and end the controversy."</p>

<p>"Nay, under your favour, my worthy host,"
said Arthur, "it is but some foolish rhymes addressed
to the maiden's own eye."</p>

<p>"And under your favour, sir," said the Landamman,
"whatsoever is fit for my niece's eyes
may greet my ears."</p>

<p>He took the scroll from the maiden, who blushed
deeply when she resigned it. The character in
which it was written was so fine that the Landamman
in surprise exclaimed, "No clerk of St.
Gall could have written more fairly.&mdash;Strange,"
he again repeated, "that a hand which could draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
so true a bow, should have the cunning to form
characters so fair." He then exclaimed anew,
"Ha! verses, by Our Lady! What, have we minstrels
disguised as traders?" He then opened the
scroll, and read the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>If I hit mast, and line, and bird,</p>
<p>An English archer keeps his word.</p>
<p>Ah! maiden, didst thou aim at me,</p>
<p>A single glance were worth the three.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Here is rare rhyming, my worthy guest," said
the Landamman, shaking his head; "fine words
to make foolish maidens fain. But do not excuse
it; it is your country-fashion, and we know how
to treat it as such." And without further allusion
to the concluding couplet, the reading of which
threw the poet as well as the object of the verses
into some discomposure, he added gravely, "You
must now allow, Rudolph Donnerhugel, that the
stranger has fairly attained the three marks which
he proposed to himself."</p>

<p>"That he has attained them is plain," answered
the party to whom the appeal was made; "but
that he has done this fairly may be doubted, if
there are such things as witchery and magic in
this world."</p>

<p>"Shame, shame, Rudolph!" said the Landamman.
"Can spleen and envy have weight with
so brave a man as you, from whom my sons ought
to learn temperance, forbearance, and candour, as
well as manly courage and dexterity?"</p>

<p>The Bernese coloured high under this rebuke, to
which he ventured not to attempt a reply.</p>

<p>"To your sports till sunset, my children," continued
Arnold; "while I and my worthy friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
occupy our time with a walk, for which the evening
is now favourable."</p>

<p>"Methinks," said the English merchant, "I
should like to visit the ruins of yonder castle,
situated by the waterfall. There is something of
melancholy dignity in such a scene which reconciles
us to the misfortunes of our own time, by
showing that our ancestors, who were perhaps
more intelligent or more powerful, have nevertheless,
in their days, encountered cares and distresses
similar to those which we now groan under."</p>

<p>"Have with you, my worthy sir," replied his
host; "there will be time also upon the road to
talk of things that you should know."</p>

<p>The slow step of the two elderly men carried
them by degrees from the limits of the lawn,
where shout and laugh and halloo were again
revived. Young Philipson, whose success as an
archer had obliterated all recollection of former
failure, made other attempts to mingle in the
manly pastimes of the country, and gained a considerable
portion of applause. The young men,
who had but lately been so ready to join in ridiculing
him, now began to consider him as a person
to be looked up and appealed to; while Rudolph
Donnerhugel saw with resentment that he was no
longer without a rival in the opinion of his male
cousins, perhaps of his kinswoman also. The proud
young Swiss reflected with bitterness that he had
fallen under the Landamman's displeasure, declined
in reputation with his companions, of whom
he had been hitherto the leader, and even hazarded
a more mortifying disappointment, all, as his
swelling heart expressed it, through the means of
a stranger stripling, of neither blood nor fame, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
could not step from one rock to another without
the encouragement of a girl.</p>

<p>In this irritated mood, he drew near the young
Englishman, and while he seemed to address him
on the chances of the sports which were still proceeding,
he conveyed, in a whisper, matter of a
far different tendency. Striking Arthur's shoulder
with the frank bluntness of a mountaineer, he said
aloud: "Yonder bolt of Ernest whistled through
the air like a falcon when she stoops down the
wind!" and then proceeded in a deep low voice,
"You merchants sell gloves&mdash;do you ever deal in
single gauntlets, or only in pairs?"</p>

<p>"I <i>sell</i> no single glove," said Arthur, instantly
apprehending him, and sufficiently disposed to
resent the scornful looks of the Bernese champion
during the time of their meal, and his having but
lately imputed his successful shooting to chance or
sorcery,&mdash;"I <i>sell</i> no single glove, sir, but never
refuse to exchange one."</p>

<p>"You are apt, I see," said Rudolph. "Look at
the players while I speak, or our purpose will be
suspected.&mdash;You are quicker, I say, of apprehension
than I expected. If we exchange our gloves,
how shall each redeem his own?"</p>

<p>"With our good swords," said Arthur Philipson.</p>

<p>"In armour, or as we stand?"</p>

<p>"Even as we stand," said Arthur. "I have no
better garment of proof than this doublet&mdash;no
other weapon than my sword; and these, Sir
Switzer, I hold enough for the purpose.&mdash;Name
time and place."</p>

<p>"The old castle-court at Geierstein," replied Rudolph;
"the time sunrise;&mdash;but we are watched.&mdash;I
have lost my wager, stranger," he added,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
speaking aloud, and in an indifferent tone of voice,
"since Ulrick has made a cast beyond Ernest.&mdash;There
is my glove, in token I shall not forget the
flask of wine."</p>

<p>"And there is mine," said Arthur, "in token I
will drink it with you merrily."</p>

<p>Thus, amid the peaceful though rough sports of
their companions, did these two hot-headed youths
contrive to indulge their hostile inclinations towards
each other, by settling a meeting of deadly
purpose.

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i16">                              I was one</p>
<p>Who loved the greenwood bank and lowing herd,</p>
<p>The russet prize, the lowly peasant's life,</p>
<p>Season'd with sweet content, more than the halls</p>
<p>Where revellers feast to fever-height. Believe me,</p>
<p>There ne'er was poison mix'd in maple bowl.</p>

<p class="i16"><span class="smcap">Anonymous.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Leaving the young persons engaged with their
sports, the Landamman of Unterwalden and the
elder Philipson walked on in company, conversing
chiefly on the political relations of France, England,
and Burgundy, until the conversation was
changed as they entered the gate of the old castle-yard
of Geierstein, where arose the lonely and
dismantled keep, surrounded by the ruins of other
buildings.</p>

<p>"This has been a proud and a strong habitation
in its time," said Philipson.</p>

<p>"They were a proud and powerful race who held
it," replied the Landamman. "The Counts of
Geierstein have a history which runs back to the
times of the old Helvetians, and their deeds are
reported to have matched their antiquity. But all
earthly grandeur has an end, and free men tread
the ruins of their feudal castle, at the most distant
sight of whose turrets serfs were formerly obliged
to vail their bonnets, if they would escape the
chastisement of contumacious rebels."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>"I observe," said the merchant, "engraved on
a stone under yonder turret, the crest, I conceive,
of the last family, a vulture perched on a rock,
descriptive, doubtless, of the word Geierstein."</p>

<p>"It is the ancient cognisance of the family,"
replied Arnold Biederman, "and, as you say,
expresses the name of the castle, being the
same with that of the knights who so long held
it."</p>

<p>"I also remarked in your hall," continued the
merchant, "a helmet bearing the same crest or
cognisance. It is, I suppose, a trophy of the triumph
of the Swiss peasants over the nobles of
Geierstein, as the English bow is preserved in
remembrance of the battle of Buttisholz?"</p>

<p>"And you, fair sir," replied the Landamman,
"would, I perceive, from the prejudices of your
education, regard the one victory with as unpleasant
feelings as the other?&mdash;Strange, that the
veneration for rank should be rooted even in the
minds of those who have no claim to share it!
But clear up your downcast brows, my worthy
guest, and be assured, that though many a proud
baron's castle, when Switzerland threw off the
bonds of feudal slavery, was plundered and destroyed
by the just vengeance of an incensed
people, such was not the lot of Geierstein. The
blood of the old possessors of these towers still
flows in the veins of him by whom these lands
are occupied."</p>

<p>"What am I to understand by that, Sir Landamman?"
said Philipson. "Are not you yourself
the occupant of this place?"</p>

<p>"And you think, probably," answered Arnold,
"because I live like the other shepherds, wear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
homespun grey, and hold the plough with my
own hands, I cannot be descended from a line
of ancient nobility? This land holds many such
gentle peasants, Sir Merchant; nor is there a more
ancient nobility than that of which the remains
are to be found in my native country. But they
have voluntarily resigned the oppressive part of
their feudal power, and are no longer regarded as
wolves amongst the flock, but as sagacious mastiffs,
who attend the sheep in time of peace, and
are prompt in their defence when war threatens
our community."</p>

<p>"But," repeated the merchant, who could not
yet reconcile himself to the idea that his plain
and peasant-seeming host was a man of distinguished
birth, "you bear not the name, worthy
sir, of your fathers&mdash;They were, you say, the
Counts of Geierstein, and you are"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arnold Biederman, at your command," answered
the magistrate. "But know,&mdash;if the
knowledge can make you sup with more sense of
dignity or comfort,&mdash;I need but put on yonder old
helmet, or, if that were too much trouble, I have
only to stick a falcon's feather into my cap, and
call myself Arnold, Count of Geierstein. No man
could gainsay me&mdash;though whether it would
become my Lord Count to drive his bullocks to the
pasture, and whether his Excellency the High and
Well-born could, without derogation, sow a field
or reap it, are questions which should be settled
beforehand. I see you are confounded, my respected
guest, at my degeneracy; but the state of
my family is very soon explained.</p>

<p>"My lordly fathers ruled this same domain of
Geierstein, which in their time was very extensive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
much after the mode of feudal barons&mdash;that is,
they were sometimes the protectors and patrons,
but oftener the oppressors of their subjects. But
when my grandfather, Heinrich of Geierstein,
flourished, he not only joined the Confederates to
repel Ingelram de Couci and his roving bands, as
I already told you, but, when the wars with
Austria were renewed, and many of his degree
joined with the host of the Emperor Leopold, my
ancestor adopted the opposite side, fought in front
of the Confederates, and contributed by his skill
and valour to the decisive victory at Sempach, in
which Leopold lost his life, and the flower of
Austrian chivalry fell around him. My father,
Count Williewald, followed the same course, both
from inclination and policy. He united himself
closely with the state of Unterwalden, became a
citizen of the Confederacy, and distinguished himself
so much that he was chosen Landamman of
the Republic. He had two sons,&mdash;myself, and a
younger brother, Albert; and possessed, as he felt
himself, of a species of double character, he was
desirous, perhaps unwisely (if I may censure the
purpose of a deceased parent), that one of his sons
should succeed him in his Lordship of Geierstein,
and the other support the less ostentatious,
though not in my thought less honourable condition,
of a free citizen of Unterwalden, possessing
such influence among his equals in the Canton as
might be acquired by his father's merits and his
own. When Albert was twelve years old, our
father took us on a short excursion to Germany,
where the form, pomp, and magnificence which
we witnessed made a very different impression on
the mind of my brother and on my own. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
appeared to Albert the consummation of earthly
splendour seemed to me a weary display of tiresome
and useless ceremonials. Our father explained
his purpose, and offered to me, as his
eldest son, the large estate belonging to Geierstein,
reserving such a portion of the most fertile ground
as might make my brother one of the wealthiest
citizens, in a district where competence is esteemed
wealth. The tears gushed from Albert's eyes&mdash;'And
must my brother,' he said, 'be a noble Count,
honoured and followed by vassals and attendants,
and I a homespun peasant among the grey-bearded
shepherds of Unterwalden?&mdash;No, father&mdash;I respect
your will&mdash;but I will not sacrifice my own
rights. Geierstein is a fief held of the empire, and
the laws entitle me to my equal half of the lands.
If my brother be Count of Geierstein, I am not
the less Count Albert of Geierstein; and I will
appeal to the Emperor, rather than that the arbitrary
will of one ancestor, though he be my father,
shall cancel in me the rank and rights which I
have derived from a hundred.' My father was
greatly incensed. 'Go,' he said, 'proud boy, give
the enemy of thy country a pretext to interfere in
her affairs&mdash;appeal to the will of a foreign prince
from the pleasure of thy father. Go, but never
again look me in the face, and dread my eternal
malediction!' Albert was about to reply with
vehemence, when I entreated him to be silent and
hear me speak. I had, I said, all my life loved
the mountain better than the plain; had been
more pleased to walk than to ride; more proud to
contend with shepherds in their sports than with
nobles in the lists; and happier in the village
dance than among the feasts of the German nobles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
'Let me, therefore,' I said, 'be a citizen of the
republic of Unterwalden; you will relieve me of
a thousand cares; and let my brother Albert wear
the coronet and bear the honours of Geierstein.'
After some further discussion, my father was at
length contented to adopt my proposal, in order
to attain the object which he had so much at
heart. Albert was declared heir of his castle and
his rank, by the title of Count Albert of Geierstein;
and I was placed in possession of these
fields and fertile meadows amidst which my house
is situated, and my neighbours called me Arnold
Biederman."</p>

<p>"And if Biederman," said the merchant, "means,
as I understand the word, a man of worth, candour,
and generosity, I know none on whom the epithet
could be so justly conferred. Yet let me observe,
that I praise the conduct which, in your circumstances,
I could not have bowed my spirit to
practise. Proceed, I pray you, with the history
of your house, if the recital be not painful to
you."</p>

<p>"I have little more to say," replied the Landamman.
"My father died soon after the settlement
of his estate in the manner I have told you.
My brother had other possessions in Swabia and
Westphalia, and seldom visited his paternal castle,
which was chiefly occupied by a seneschal, a man
so obnoxious to the vassals of the family, that but
for the protection afforded by my near residence,
and relationship with his lord, he would have been
plucked out of the Vulture's Nest, and treated
with as little ceremony as if he had been the vulture
himself. Neither, to say the truth, did my
brother's occasional visits to Geierstein afford his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
vassals much relief, or acquire any popularity for
himself. He heard with the ears and saw with
the eyes of his cruel and interested steward, Ital
Schreckenwald, and would not listen even to my
interference and admonition. Indeed, though he
always demeaned himself with personal kindness
towards me, I believe he considered me as a dull
and poor-spirited clown, who had disgraced my
noble blood by my mean propensities. He showed
contempt on every occasion for the prejudices of
his countrymen, and particularly by wearing a
peacock's feather in public, and causing his followers
to display the same badge, though the
cognisance of the House of Austria, and so unpopular
in this country, that men have been put
to death for no better reason than for carrying it
in their caps. In the meantime I was married to
my Bertha, now a saint in heaven, by whom I
had six stately sons, five of whom you saw surrounding
my table this day. Albert also married.
His wife was a lady of rank in Westphalia, but
his bridal-bed was less fruitful; he had only one
daughter, Anne of Geierstein. Then came on the
wars between the city of Zurich and our Forest
Cantons, in which so much blood was shed, and
when our brethren of Zurich were so ill advised as
to embrace the alliance of Austria. Their Emperor
strained every nerve to avail himself of the favourable
opportunity afforded by the disunion of the
Swiss, and engaged all with whom he had influence
to second his efforts. With my brother he
was but too successful; for Albert not only took
arms in the Emperor's cause, but admitted into
the strong fortress of Geierstein a band of Austrian
soldiers, with whom the wicked Ital Schreckenwald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
laid waste the whole country, excepting my little
patrimony."</p>

<p>"It came to a severe pass with you, my worthy
host," said the merchant, "since you were to
decide against the cause of your country or that
of your brother."</p>

<p>"I did not hesitate," continued Arnold Biederman.
"My brother was in the Emperor's army,
and I was not therefore reduced to act personally
against him; but I denounced war against the
robbers and thieves with whom Schreckenwald had
filled my father's house. It was waged with various
fortune. The seneschal, during my absence,
burnt down my house, and slew my youngest son,
who died, alas! in defence of his father's hearth.
It is little to add that my lands were wasted and
my flocks destroyed. On the other hand, I succeeded,
with help of a body of the peasants of
Unterwalden, in storming the Castle of Geierstein.
It was offered back to me by the Confederates; but
I had no desire to sully the fair cause in which I
had assumed arms, by enriching myself at the
expense of my brother; and besides, to have dwelt
in that guarded hold would have been a penance to
one the sole protectors of whose house of late years
had been a latch and a shepherd's cur. The castle
was therefore dismantled, as you see, by order of
the elders of the Canton; and I even think that,
considering the uses it was too often put to, I look
with more pleasure on the rugged remains of
Geierstein, than I ever did when it was entire,
and apparently impregnable."</p>

<p>"I can understand your feelings," said the Englishman,
"though I repeat, my virtue would not
perhaps have extended so far beyond the circle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
my family affections.&mdash;Your brother, what said
he to your patriotic exertions?"</p>

<p>"He was, as I learnt," answered the Landamman,
"dreadfully incensed, having no doubt been
informed that I had taken his castle with a view
to my own aggrandisement. He even swore he
would renounce my kindred, seek me through the
battle, and slay me with his own hand. We were,
in fact, both at the battle of Freyenbach, but my
brother was prevented from attempting the execution
of his vindictive purpose by a wound from an
arrow, which occasioned his being carried out of
the mêlée. I was afterwards in the bloody and
melancholy fight at Mount-Herzel, and that other
onslaught at the Chapel of St. Jacob [<a href="#ednote_d" name="enanchor_d" id="enanchor_d" ><i>d</i></a>], which
brought our brethren of Zurich to terms, and
reduced Austria once more to the necessity of
making peace with us. After this war of thirteen
years, the Diet passed sentence of banishment for
life on my brother Albert, and would have deprived
him of his possessions, but forbore in consideration
of what they thought my good service. When the
sentence was intimated to the Count of Geierstein,
he returned an answer of defiance; yet a singular
circumstance showed us not long afterwards that
he retained an attachment to his country, and
amidst his resentment against me, his brother, did
justice to my unaltered affection for him."</p>

<p>"I would pledge my credit," said the merchant,
"that what follows relates to yonder fair maiden,
your niece?"</p>

<p>"You guess rightly," said the Landamman.
"For some time we heard, though indistinctly (for
we have, as you know, but little communication
with foreign countries), that my brother was high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
in favour at the court of the Emperor, but latterly
that he had fallen under suspicion, and, in the
course of some of those revolutions common at the
courts of princes, had been driven into exile. It
was shortly after this news, and, as I think, more
than seven years ago, that I was returning from
hunting on the farther side of the river, had
passed the narrow bridge as usual, and was walking
through the courtyard which we have lately
left" (for their walk was now turned homeward),
"when a voice said, in the German language,
'Uncle, have compassion upon me!' As I looked
around, I beheld a girl of ten years old approach
timidly from the shelter of the ruins, and kneel
down at my feet. 'Uncle, spare my life,' she
said, holding up her little hands in the act of supplication,
while mortal terror was painted upon
her countenance.&mdash;'Am I your uncle, little
maiden?' said I; 'and if I am, why should you
fear me?'&mdash;'Because you are the head of the
wicked and base clowns who delight to spill noble
blood,' replied the girl, with a courage which
surprised me.&mdash;'What is your name, my little
maiden?' said I; 'and who, having planted in
your mind opinions so unfavourable to your kinsman,
has brought you hither, to see if he resembles
the picture you have received of him?'&mdash;'It
was Ital Schreckenwald that brought me hither,'
said the girl, only half comprehending the nature
of my question.&mdash;'Ital Schreckenwald?' I repeated,
shocked at the name of a wretch I have so
much reason to hate. A voice from the ruins,
like that of a sullen echo from the grave, answered,
'Ital Schreckenwald!' and the caitiff issued from
his place of concealment, and stood before me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
with that singular indifference to danger which
he unites to his atrocity of character. I had my
spiked mountain-staff in my hand&mdash;What should
I have done&mdash;or what would you have done, under
like circumstances?"</p>

<p>"I would have laid him on the earth, with his
skull shivered like an icicle!" said the Englishman,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"I had well-nigh done so," replied the Swiss,
"but he was unarmed, a messenger from my
brother, and therefore no object of revenge. His
own undismayed and audacious conduct contributed
to save him. 'Let the vassal of the noble
and high-born Count of Geierstein hear the words
of his master, and let him look that they are
obeyed,' said the insolent ruffian. 'Doff thy cap,
and listen; for though the voice is mine, the
words are those of the noble Count.'&mdash;'God and
man know,' replied I, 'if I owe my brother
respect or homage&mdash;it is much if, in respect for
him, I defer paying to his messenger the meed I
dearly owe him. Proceed with thy tale, and rid
me of thy hateful presence.'&mdash;'Albert Count of
Geierstein, thy lord and my lord,' proceeded
Schreckenwald, 'having on his hand wars, and
other affairs of weight, sends his daughter, the
Countess Anne, to thy charge, and graces thee so
far as to intrust to thee her support and nurture,
until it shall suit his purposes to require her back
from thee; and he desires that thou apply to her
maintenance the rents and profits of the lands of
Geierstein, which thou hast usurped from him.'&mdash;'Ital
Schreckenwald,' I replied, 'I will not stop
to ask if this mode of addressing me be according
to my brother's directions, or thine own insolent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
pleasure. If circumstances have, as thou sayest,
deprived my niece of her natural protector, I will
be to her as a father, nor shall she want aught
which I have to give her. The lands of Geierstein
are forfeited to the state, the castle is ruinous, as
thou seest, and it is much of thy crimes that the
house of my fathers is desolate. But where I
dwell Anne of Geierstein shall dwell, as my
children fare shall she fare, and she shall be to
me as a daughter. And now thou hast thine
errand&mdash;Go hence, if thou lovest thy life; for it
is unsafe parleying with the father, when thy
hands are stained with the blood of the son.'
The wretch retired as I spoke, but took his leave
with his usual determined insolence of manner.&mdash;'Farewell,'
he said, 'Count of the Plough and
Harrow&mdash;farewell, noble companion of paltry
burghers!' He disappeared, and released me from
the strong temptation under which I laboured, and
which urged me to stain with his blood the place
which had witnessed his cruelty and his crimes.
I conveyed my niece to my house, and soon convinced
her that I was her sincere friend. I inured
her, as if she had been my daughter, to all our
mountain exercises; and while she excels in these
the damsels of the district, there burst from her
such sparkles of sense and courage, mingled with
delicacy, as belong not&mdash;I must needs own the
truth&mdash;to the simple maidens of these wild hills,
but relish of a nobler stem, and higher breeding.
Yet they are so happily mixed with simplicity
and courtesy, that Anne of Geierstein is justly
considered as the pride of the district; nor do I
doubt but that, if she should make a worthy
choice of a husband, the state would assign her a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
large dower out of her father's possessions, since
it is not our maxim to punish the child for the
faults of the parent."</p>

<p>"It will naturally be your anxious desire, my
worthy host," replied the Englishman, "to secure
to your niece, in whose praises I have deep cause
to join with a grateful voice, such a suitable
match as her birth and expectations, but above all
her merit, demand."</p>

<p>"It is, my good guest," said the Landamman,
"that which hath often occupied my thoughts.
The over-near relationship prohibits what would
have been my most earnest desire, the hope of
seeing her wedded to one of my own sons. This
young man, Rudolph Donnerhugel, is brave, and
highly esteemed by his fellow-citizens; but more
ambitious, and more desirous of distinction, than
I would desire for my niece's companion through
life. His temper is violent, though his heart, I
trust, is good. But I am like to be unpleasantly
released from all care on this score, since my
brother, having, as it seemed, forgotten Anne for
seven years and upwards, has, by a letter which I
have lately received, demanded that she shall be
restored to him.&mdash;You can read, my worthy sir,
for your profession requires it. See, here is the
scroll, coldly worded, but far less unkindly than
his unbrotherly message by Ital Schreckenwald&mdash;Read
it, I pray you, aloud."</p>

<p>The merchant read accordingly.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Brother</span>&mdash;I thank you for the care you have taken
of my daughter, for she has been in safety when she
would otherwise have been in peril, and kindly used,
when she would have been in hardship. I now entreat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
you to restore her to me, and trust that she will come
with the virtues which become a woman in every
station, and a disposition to lay aside the habits of a
Swiss villager, for the graces of a high-born maiden.&mdash;Adieu.
I thank you once more for your care, and
would repay it were it in my power; but you need
nothing I can give, having renounced the rank to
which you were born, and made your nest on the
ground where the storm passes over you. I rest your
brother,</p>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Geierstein</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>"It is addressed 'to Count Arnold of Geierstein,
called Arnold Biederman.' A postscript requires
you to send the maiden to the court of the Duke
of Burgundy.&mdash;This, good sir, appears to me
the language of a haughty man, divided betwixt
the recollection of old offence and recent obligation.
The speech of his messenger was that
of a malicious vassal, desirous of venting his
own spite under pretence of doing his lord's
errand."</p>

<p>"I so receive both," replied Arnold Biederman.</p>

<p>"And do you intend," continued the merchant,
"to resign this beautiful and interesting creature
to the conduct of her father, wilful as he seems
to be, without knowing what his condition is, or
what his power of protecting her?"</p>

<p>The Landamman hastened to reply. "The tie
which unites the parent to the child is the earliest
and the most hallowed that binds the human
race. The difficulty of her travelling in safety has
hitherto prevented my attempting to carry my
brother's instructions into execution. But as I
am now likely to journey in person towards the
court of Charles, I have determined that Anne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
shall accompany me; and as I will myself converse
with my brother, whom I have not seen for
many years, I shall learn his purpose respecting
his daughter, and it may be I may prevail on
Albert to suffer her to remain under my charge.&mdash;And
now, sir, having told you of my family affairs
at some greater length than was necessary, I must
crave your attention, as a wise man, to what
further I have to say. You know the disposition
which young men and women naturally have to
talk, jest, and sport with each other, out of which
practice arise often more serious attachments,
which they call loving <i>par amours</i>. I trust, if
we are to travel together, you will so school your
young man as to make him aware that Anne of
Geierstein cannot, with propriety on her part, be
made the object of his thoughts or attentions."</p>

<p>The merchant coloured with resentment, or
something like it. "I asked not to join your company,
Sir Landamman&mdash;it was you who requested
mine," he said; "if my son and I have since
become in any respect the objects of your suspicion,
we will gladly pursue our way separately."</p>

<p>"Nay, be not angry, worthy guest," said the
Landamman; "we Switzers do not rashly harbour
suspicions; and that we may not harbour them,
we speak, respecting the circumstances out of
which they might arise, more plainly than is the
wont of more civilised countries. When I proposed
to you to be my companion on the journey,
to speak the truth, though it may displease a
father's ear, I regarded your son as a soft, faint-hearted
youth, who was, as yet at least, too timid
and milky-blooded to attract either respect or
regard from the maidens. But a few hours have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
presented him to us in the character of such a one
as is sure to interest them. He has accomplished
the emprise of the bow, long thought unattainable,
and with which a popular report connects an idle
prophecy. He has wit to make verses, and knows
doubtless how to recommend himself by other
accomplishments which bind young persons to
each other, though they are lightly esteemed by
men whose beards are mixed with grey, like yours,
friend merchant, and mine own. Now, you must
be aware, that since my brother broke terms with
me, simply for preferring the freedom of a Swiss
citizen to the tawdry and servile condition of a
German courtier, he will not approve of any one
looking towards his daughter who hath not the
advantage of noble blood, or who hath, what he
would call, debased himself by attention to merchandise,
to the cultivation of land&mdash;in a word,
to any art that is useful. Should your son love
Anne of Geierstein, he prepares for himself danger
and disappointment. And, now you know the
whole,&mdash;I ask you, Do we travel together or
apart?"</p>

<p>"Even as ye list, my worthy host," said Philipson,
in an indifferent tone; "for me, I can but say
that such an attachment as you speak of would be
as contrary to my wishes as to those of your
brother, or what I suppose are your own. Arthur
Philipson has duties to perform totally inconsistent
with his playing the gentle bachelor to any
maiden in Switzerland, take Germany to boot,
whether of high or low degree. He is an obedient
son, besides&mdash;hath never seriously disobeyed my
commands, and I will have an eye upon his
motions."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"Enough, my friend," said the Landamman;
"we travel together, then, and I willingly keep
my original purpose, being both pleased and
instructed by your discourse."</p>

<p>Then changing the conversation, he began to ask
whether his acquaintance thought that the league
entered into by the King of England and the Duke
of Burgundy would continue stable. "We hear
much," continued the Swiss, "of the immense
army with which King Edward proposes the
recovery of the English dominions in France."</p>

<p>"I am well aware," said Philipson, "that nothing
can be so popular in my country as the invasion of
France, and the attempt to reconquer Normandy,
Maine, and Gascony, the ancient appanages of our
English crown. But I greatly doubt whether the
voluptuous usurper, who now calls himself king,
will be graced by Heaven with success in such an
adventure. This Fourth Edward is brave indeed,
and has gained every battle in which he drew his
sword, and they have been many in number. But
since he reached, through a bloody path, to the
summit of his ambition, he has shown himself
rather a sensual debauchee than a valiant knight;
and it is my firm belief, that not even the chance
of recovering all the fair dominions which were
lost during the civil wars excited by his ambitious
house will tempt him to exchange the soft beds of
London, with sheets of silk and pillows of down,
and the music of a dying lute to lull him to rest,
for the turf of France and the réveille of an alarm
trumpet."</p>

<p>"It is the better for us should it prove so," said
the Landamman; "for if England and Burgundy
were to dismember France, as in our father's days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
was nearly accomplished, Duke Charles would
then have leisure to exhaust his long-hoarded
vengeance against our Confederacy."</p>

<p>As they conversed thus, they attained once more
the lawn in front of Arnold Biederman's mansion,
where the contention of the young men had given
place to the dance performed by the young persons
of both sexes. The dance was led by Anne
of Geierstein and the youthful stranger; which,
although it was the most natural arrangement,
where the one was a guest, and the other represented
the mistress of the family, occasioned the
Landamman's exchanging a glance with the elder
Philipson, as if it had held some relation to the
suspicions he had recently expressed.</p>

<p>But so soon as her uncle and his elder guest
appeared, Anne of Geierstein took the earliest
opportunity of a pause to break off the dance, and
to enter into conversation with her kinsman, as
if on the domestic affairs under her attendance.
Philipson observed that his host listened seriously
to his niece's communication; and, nodding in his
frank manner, seemed to intimate that her request
should receive a favourable consideration.</p>

<p>The family were presently afterwards summoned
to attend the evening meal, which consisted chiefly
of the excellent fish afforded by the neighbouring
streams and lakes. A large cup, containing what
was called the <i>schlaf-trunk</i>, or sleeping-drink, then
went round, which was first quaffed by the master
of the household, then modestly tasted by the
maiden, next pledged by the two strangers, and
finally emptied by the rest of the company. Such
were then the sober manners of the Swiss, afterwards
much corrupted by their intercourse with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
more luxurious regions. The guests were conducted
to the sleeping-apartments, where Philipson and
young Arthur occupied the same couch, and shortly
after the whole inhabitants of the household were
locked in sound repose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>When we two meet, we meet like rushing torrents;</p>
<p>Like warring winds, like flames from various points,</p>
<p>That mate each other's fury&mdash;there is naught</p>
<p>Of elemental strife, were fiends to guide it,</p>
<p>Can match the wrath of man.</p>

<p class="i16"><span class="smcap">Frenaud.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>The elder of our two travellers, though a strong
man and familiar with fatigue, slept sounder and
longer than usual on the morning which was now
beginning to dawn, but his son Arthur had that
upon his mind which early interrupted his repose.</p>

<p>The encounter with the bold Switzer, a chosen
man of a renowned race of warriors, was an engagement
which, in the opinion of the period in
which he lived, was not to be delayed or broken.
He left his father's side, avoiding as much as possible
the risk of disturbing him, though even in
that case the circumstance would not have excited
any attention, as he was in the habit of rising
early, in order to make preparations for the day's
journey, to see that the guide was on his duty,
and that the mule had his provender, and to discharge
similar offices which might otherwise have
given trouble to his father. The old man, however,
fatigued with the exertions of the preceding
day, slept, as we have said, more soundly than
his wont, and Arthur, arming himself with his
good sword, sallied out to the lawn in front of the
Landamman's dwelling, amid the magic dawn of a
beautiful harvest morning in the Swiss mountains.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>The sun was just about to kiss the top of the
most gigantic of that race of Titans, though the
long shadows still lay on the rough grass, which
crisped under the young man's feet with a strong
intimation of frost. But Arthur looked not round
on the landscape, however lovely, which lay waiting
one flash from the orb of day to start into brilliant
existence. He drew the belt of his trusty
sword which he was in the act of fastening when
he left the house, and ere he had secured the
buckle he was many paces on his way towards the
place where he was to use it.</p>

<p>It was still the custom of that military period
to regard a summons to combat as a sacred engagement,
preferable to all others which could be
formed; and stifling whatever inward feelings of
reluctance Nature might oppose to the dictates of
fashion, the step of a gallant to the place of encounter
was required to be as free and ready as if
he had been going to a bridal. I do not know
whether this alacrity was altogether real on the
part of Arthur Philipson; but, if it were otherwise,
neither his look nor pace betrayed the
secret.</p>

<p>Having hastily traversed the fields and groves
which separated the Landamman's residence from
the old castle of Geierstein, he entered the courtyard
from the side where the castle overlooked the
land; and nearly in the same instant his almost
gigantic antagonist, who looked yet more tall and
burly by the pale morning light than he had
seemed the preceding evening, appeared ascending
from the precarious bridge beside the torrent, having
reached Geierstein by a different route from
that pursued by the Englishman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>The young champion of Berne had hanging along
his back one of those huge two-handed swords,
the blade of which measured five feet, and which
were wielded with both hands. These were almost
universally used by the Swiss; for, besides the
impression which such weapons were calculated
to make upon the array of the German men-at-arms,
whose armour was impenetrable to lighter
swords, they were also well calculated to defend
mountain passes, where the great bodily strength
and agility of those who bore them enabled the
combatants, in spite of their weight and length,
to use them with much address and effect. One
of these gigantic swords hung round Rudolph
Donnerhugel's neck, the point rattling against his
heel, and the handle extending itself over his left
shoulder, considerably above his head. He carried
another in his hand.</p>

<p>"Thou art punctual," he called out to Arthur
Philipson, in a voice which was distinctly heard
above the roar of the waterfall, which it seemed to
rival in sullen force. "But I judged thou wouldst
come without a two-handed sword. There is my
kinsman Ernest's," he said, throwing on the
ground the weapon which he carried, with the
hilt towards the young Englishman. "Look,
stranger, that thou disgrace it not, for my kinsman
will never forgive me if thou dost. Or thou
mayst have mine if thou likest it better."</p>

<p>The Englishman looked at the weapon with
some surprise, to the use of which he was totally
unaccustomed.</p>

<p>"The challenger," he said, "in all countries
where honour is known, accepts the arms of the
challenged."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"He who fights on a Swiss mountain, fights
with a Swiss brand," answered Rudolph. "Think
you our hands are made to handle penknives?"</p>

<p>"Nor are ours made to wield scythes," said
Arthur; and muttered betwixt his teeth, as he
looked at the sword, which the Swiss continued
to offer him&mdash;"<i>Usum non habeo</i> [<a href="#ednote_e" name="enanchor_e" id="enanchor_e" ><i>e</i></a>], I have not
proved the weapon."</p>

<p>"Do you repent the bargain you have made?"
said the Swiss; "if so, cry craven, and return in
safety. Speak plainly, instead of prattling Latin
like a clerk or a shaven monk."</p>

<p>"No, proud man," replied the Englishman, "I
ask thee no forbearance. I thought but of a combat
between a shepherd and a giant, in which God
gave the victory to him who had worse odds of
weapons than falls to my lot to-day. I will fight
as I stand; my own good sword shall serve my
need now, as it has done before."</p>

<p>"Content!&mdash;But blame not me who offered thee
equality of weapons," said the mountaineer. "And
now hear me. This is a fight for life or death&mdash;yon
waterfall sounds the alarum for our conflict.&mdash;Yes,
old bellower," he continued, looking back,
"it is long since thou hast heard the noise of
battle;&mdash;and look at it ere we begin, stranger, for
if you fall, I will commit your body to its waters."</p>

<p>"And if thou fall'st, proud Swiss," answered
Arthur, "as well I trust thy presumption leads to
destruction, I will have thee buried in the church
at Einsiedlen, where the priests shall sing masses
for thy soul&mdash;thy two-handed sword shall be displayed
above thy grave, and a scroll shall tell the
passenger, Here lies a bear's cub of Berne, slain
by Arthur the Englishman."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"The stone is not in Switzerland, rocky as it
is," said Rudolph, scornfully, "that shall bear
that inscription. Prepare thyself for battle."</p>

<p>The Englishman cast a calm and deliberate glance
around the scene of action&mdash;a courtyard, partly
open, partly encumbered with ruins, in less and
larger masses.</p>

<p>"Methinks," said he to himself, "a master of
his weapon, with the instructions of Bottaferma of
Florence in his remembrance, a light heart, a good
blade, a firm hand, and a just cause, might make
up a worse odds than two feet of steel."</p>

<p>Thinking thus, and imprinting on his mind, as
much as the time would permit, every circumstance
of the locality around him which promised
advantage in the combat, and taking his station in
the middle of the courtyard where the ground was
entirely clear, he flung his cloak from him, and
drew his sword.</p>

<p>Rudolph had at first believed that his foreign
antagonist was an effeminate youth, who would be
swept from before him at the first flourish of his
tremendous weapon. But the firm and watchful
attitude assumed by the young man reminded the
Swiss of the deficiencies of his own unwieldy implement,
and made him determine to avoid any
precipitation which might give advantage to an
enemy who seemed both daring and vigilant. He
unsheathed his huge sword, by drawing it over
the left shoulder, an operation which required
some little time, and might have offered formidable
advantage to his antagonist, had Arthur's
sense of honour permitted him to begin the attack
ere it was completed. The Englishman remained
firm, however, until the Swiss, displaying his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
bright brand to the morning sun, made three or
four flourishes as if to prove its weight, and the
facility with which he wielded it&mdash;then stood
firm within sword-stroke of his adversary, grasping
his weapon with both hands, and advancing
it a little before his body, with the blade pointed
straight upwards. The Englishman, on the contrary,
carried his sword in one hand, holding it
across his face in a horizontal position, so as to
be at once ready to strike, thrust, or parry.</p>

<p>"Strike, Englishman!" said the Switzer, after
they had confronted each other in this manner for
about a minute.</p>

<p>"The longest sword should strike first," said
Arthur; and the words had not left his mouth when
the Swiss sword rose, and descended with a rapidity
which, the weight and size of the weapon considered,
appeared portentous. No parry, however
dexterously interposed, could have baffled the
ruinous descent of that dreadful weapon, by which
the champion of Berne had hoped at once to begin
the battle and end it. But young Philipson had
not over-estimated the justice of his own eye, or
the activity of his limbs. Ere the blade descended,
a sudden spring to one side carried him from
beneath its heavy sway, and before the Swiss could
again raise his sword aloft he received a wound,
though a slight one, upon the left arm. Irritated
at the failure and at the wound, the Switzer
heaved up his sword once more, and availing himself
of a strength corresponding to his size, he
discharged towards his adversary a succession of
blows, downright, athwart, horizontal, and from
left to right, with such surprising strength and
velocity, that it required all the address of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
young Englishman, by parrying, shifting, eluding,
or retreating, to evade a storm of which every individual
blow seemed sufficient to cleave a solid
rock. The Englishman was compelled to give
ground, now backwards, now swerving to the one
side or the other, now availing himself of the fragments
of the ruins, but watching all the while,
with the utmost composure, the moment when the
strength of his enraged enemy might become somewhat
exhausted, or when by some improvident or
furious blow he might again lay himself open to a
close attack. The latter of these advantages had
nearly occurred, for in the middle of his headlong
charge the Switzer stumbled over a large stone
concealed among the long grass, and ere he could
recover himself received a severe blow across the
head from his antagonist. It lighted upon his
bonnet, the lining of which enclosed a small steel
cap, so that he escaped unwounded, and springing
up, renewed the battle with unabated fury, though
it seemed to the young Englishman with breath
somewhat short, and blows dealt with more
caution.</p>

<p>They were still contending with equal fortune,
when a stern voice, rising over the clash of swords,
as well as the roar of waters, called out in a commanding
tone, "On your lives, forbear!"</p>

<p>The two combatants sank the points of their
swords, not very sorry perhaps for the interruption
of a strife which must otherwise have had a deadly
termination. They looked round, and the Landamman
stood before them, with anger frowning
on his broad and expressive forehead.</p>

<p>"How now, boys?" he said. "Are you guests
of Arnold Biederman, and do you dishonour his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
house by acts of violence more becoming the
wolves of the mountains, than beings to whom the
great Creator has given a form after His own likeness,
and an immortal soul to be saved by penance
and repentance?"</p>

<p>"Arthur," said the elder Philipson, who had
come up at the same time with their host, "what
frenzy is this? Are your duties of so light and
heedless a nature, as to give time and place for
quarrels and combats with every idle boor who
chances to be boastful at once and bull-headed?"</p>

<p>The young men, whose strife had ceased at the
entrance of these unexpected spectators, stood looking
at each other, and resting on their swords.</p>

<p>"Rudolph Donnerhugel," said the Landamman,
"give thy sword to me&mdash;to me, the owner of this
ground, the master of this family, and magistrate
of the canton."</p>

<p>"And which is more," answered Rudolph, submissively,
"to you who are Arnold Biederman, at
whose command every native of these mountains
draws his sword or sheathes it."</p>

<p>He gave his two-handed sword to the Landamman.</p>

<p>"Now, by my honest word," said Biederman,
"it is the same with which thy father Stephen
fought so gloriously at Sempach, abreast with the
famous De Winkelried! Shame it is, that it should
be drawn on a helpless stranger.&mdash;And you, young
sir," continued the Swiss, addressing Arthur, while
his father said at the same time, "Young man,
yield up your sword to the Landamman."</p>

<p>"It shall not need, sir," replied the young Englishman,
"since, for my part, I hold our strife at
an end. This gallant gentleman called me hither,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
on a trial, as I conceive, of courage: I can give
my unqualified testimony to his gallantry and
swordmanship; and as I trust he will say nothing
to the shame of my manhood, I think our strife
has lasted long enough for the purpose which gave
rise to it."</p>

<p>"Too long for me," said Rudolph, frankly; "the
green sleeve of my doublet, which I wore of that
colour out of my love to the Forest Cantons, is
now stained into as dirty a crimson as could have
been done by any dyer in Ypres or Ghent. But I
heartily forgive the brave stranger who has spoiled
my jerkin, and given its master a lesson he will
not soon forget. Had all Englishmen been like
your guest, worthy kinsman, methinks the mound
at Buttisholz had hardly risen so high."</p>

<p>"Cousin Rudolph," said the Landamman, smoothing
his brow as his kinsman spoke, "I have ever
thought thee as generous as thou art harebrained
and quarrelsome; and you, my young guest, may
rely, that when a Swiss says the quarrel is over,
there is no chance of its being renewed. We are
not like the men of the valleys to the eastward,
who nurse revenge as if it were a favourite child.
And now, join hands, my children, and let us
forget this foolish feud."</p>

<p>"Here is my hand, brave stranger," said Donnerhugel;
"thou hast taught me a trick of fence,
and when we have broken our fast we will, by
your leave, to the forest, where I will teach you
a trick of woodcraft in return. When your foot
hath half the experience of your hand, and your
eye hath gained a portion of the steadiness of your
heart, you will not find many hunters to match
you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur, with all the ready confidence of youth,
readily embraced a proposition so frankly made,
and before they reached the house various subjects
of sport were eagerly discussed between them, with
as much cordiality as if no disturbance of their
concord had taken place.</p>

<p>"Now this," said the Landamman, "is as it
should be. I am ever ready to forgive the headlong
impetuosity of our youth, if they will be but
manly and open in their reconciliation, and bear
their heart on their tongue, as a true Swiss
should."</p>

<p>"These two youths had made but wild work of
it, however," said Philipson, "had not your care,
my worthy host, learned of their rendezvous, and
called me to assist in breaking their purpose.
May I ask how it came to your knowledge so
opportunely?"</p>

<p>"It was e'en through means of my domestic
fairy," answered Arnold Biederman, "who seems
born for the good luck of my family,&mdash;I mean my
niece, Anne, who had observed a glove exchanged
betwixt the two young braggadocios, and heard
them mention Geierstein and break of day. Oh,
sir, it is much to see a woman's sharpness of
wit! It would have been long enough ere any of
my thick-headed sons had shown themselves so
apprehensive."</p>

<p>"I think I see our propitious protectress peeping
at us from yonder high ground," said Philipson;
"but it seems as if she would willingly
observe us without being seen in return."</p>

<p>"Ay," said the Landamman, "she has been
looking out to see that there has been no hurt
done; and now, I warrant me, the foolish girl is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
ashamed of having shown such a laudable degree
of interest in a matter of the kind."</p>

<p>"Methinks," said the Englishman, "I would
willingly return my thanks, in your presence, to
the fair maiden to whom I have been so highly
indebted."</p>

<p>"There can be no better time than the present,"
said the Landamman; and he sent through the
groves the maiden's name, in one of those shrilly
accented tones which we have already noticed.</p>

<p>Anne of Geierstein, as Philipson had before
observed, was stationed upon a knoll at some distance,
and concealed, as she thought, from notice,
by a screen of brushwood. She started at her
uncle's summons, therefore, but presently obeyed
it; and avoiding the young men, who passed on
foremost, she joined the Landamman and Philipson,
by a circuitous path through the woods.</p>

<p>"My worthy friend and guest would speak with
you, Anne," said the Landamman, so soon as the
morning greeting had been exchanged. The Swiss
maiden coloured over brow as well as cheek, when
Philipson, with a grace which seemed beyond his
calling, addressed her in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It happens sometimes to us merchants, my fair
young friend, that we are unlucky enough not to
possess means for the instant defraying of our
debts; but he is justly held amongst us as the
meanest of mankind who does not acknowledge
them. Accept, therefore, the thanks of a father,
whose son your courage, only yesterday, saved
from destruction, and whom your prudence has,
this very morning, rescued from a great danger.
And grieve me not, by refusing to wear these earrings,"
he added, producing a small jewel-case,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
which he opened as he spoke: "they are, it is true,
only of pearls, but they have not been thought
unworthy the ears of a countess"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And must, therefore," said the old Landamman,
"show misplaced on the person of a Swiss
maiden of Unterwalden; for such and no more is
my niece Anne while she resides in my solitude.
Methinks, good Master Philipson, you display less
than your usual judgment in matching the quality
of your gifts with the rank of her on whom they
are bestowed&mdash;as a merchant, too, you should
remember that large guerdons will lighten your
gains."</p>

<p>"Let me crave your pardon, my good host,"
answered the Englishman, "while I reply, that at
least I have consulted my own sense of the obligation
under which I labour, and have chosen, out
of what I have at my free disposal, that which I
thought might best express it. I trust the host
whom I have found hitherto so kind will not prevent
this young maiden from accepting what is at
least not unbecoming the rank she is born to; and
you will judge me unjustly if you think me capable
of doing either myself or you the wrong, of
offering any token of a value beyond what I can
well spare."</p>

<p>The Landamman took the jewel-case into his
own hand.</p>

<p>"I have ever set my countenance," he said,
"against gaudy gems, which are leading us daily
further astray from the simplicity of our fathers
and mothers.&mdash;And yet," he added, with a good-humoured
smile, and holding one of the earrings
close to his relation's face, "the ornaments do set
off the wench rarely, and they say girls have more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
pleasure in wearing such toys than grey-haired men
can comprehend. Wherefore, dear Anne, as thou
hast deserved a dearer trust in a greater matter, I
refer thee entirely to thine own wisdom, to accept
of our good friend's costly present, and wear it or
not as thou thinkest fit."</p>

<p>"Since such is your pleasure, my best friend
and kinsman," said the young maiden, blushing
as she spoke, "I will not give pain to our valued
guest, by refusing what he desires so earnestly that
I should accept; but, by his leave, good uncle, and
yours, I will bestow these splendid earrings on the
shrine of Our Lady of Einsiedlen, to express our
general gratitude to her protecting favour, which
has been around us in the terrors of yesterday's
storm, and the alarms of this morning's discord."</p>

<p>"By Our Lady, the wench speaks sensibly!"
said the Landamman; "and her wisdom has
applied the bounty well, my good guest, to bespeak
prayers for thy family and mine, and for
the general peace of Unterwalden.&mdash;Go to, Anne,
thou shalt have a necklace of jet at next shearing-feast,
if our fleeces bear any price in the market."

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Let him who will not proffer'd peace receive,</p>
<p>Be sated with the plagues which war can give;</p>
<p>And well thy hatred of the peace is known,</p>
<p>If now thy soul reject the friendship shown.</p>

<p class="i16"><span class="smcap">Hoole's</span> <i>Tasso</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The confidence betwixt the Landamman and the
English merchant appeared to increase during the
course of a few busy days, which occurred before
that appointed for the commencement of their
journey to the court of Charles of Burgundy. The
state of Europe, and of the Helvetian Confederacy,
has been already alluded to; but, for the distinct
explanation of our story, may be here briefly
recapitulated.</p>

<p>In the interval of a week, whilst the English
travellers remained at Geierstein, meetings or
diets were held, as well of the City Cantons of the
Confederacy as of those of the Forest. The former,
aggrieved by the taxes imposed on their commerce
by the Duke of Burgundy, rendered yet more intolerable
by the violence of the agents whom he
employed in such oppression, were eager for war,
in which they had hitherto uniformly found victory
and wealth. Many of them were also privately
instigated to arms by the largesses of Louis
XI., who spared neither intrigues nor gold to effect
a breach betwixt these dauntless confederates and
his formidable enemy, Charles the Bold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, there were many reasons
which appeared to render it impolitic for the
Switzers to engage in war with one of the most
wealthy, most obstinate, and most powerful princes
in Europe&mdash;for such unquestionably was Charles
of Burgundy&mdash;without the existence of some
strong reason affecting their own honour and independence.
Every day brought fresh intelligence
from the interior that Edward the Fourth of England
had entered into a strict and intimate alliance,
offensive and defensive, with the Duke of
Burgundy, and that it was the purpose of the English
King, renowned for his numerous victories
over the rival House of Lancaster, by which, after
various reverses, he had obtained undisputed possession
of the throne, to reassert his claims to
those provinces of France so long held by his
ancestors. It seemed as if this alone were wanting
to his fame, and that, having subdued his
internal enemies, he now turned his eyes to the
regaining of those rich and valuable foreign possessions
which had been lost during the administration
of the feeble Henry VI. and the civil
discords so dreadfully prosecuted in the wars of
the White and Red Roses. It was universally
known, that throughout England generally the
loss of the French provinces was felt as a national
degradation; and that not only the nobility, who
had in consequence been deprived of the large fiefs
which they had held in Normandy, Gascony,
Maine, and Anjou, but the warlike gentry, accustomed
to gain both fame and wealth at the expense
of France, and the fiery yeomanry, whose bows
had decided so many fatal battles, were as eager to
renew the conflict, as their ancestors of Cressy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Poitiers, and Agincourt had been to follow their
sovereign to the fields of victory, on which their
deeds had conferred deathless renown.</p>

<p>The latest and most authentic intelligence bore,
that the King of England was on the point of
passing to France in person (an invasion rendered
easy by his possession of Calais), with an army
superior in numbers and discipline to any with
which an English monarch had ever before entered
that kingdom; that all the hostile preparations
were completed, and that the arrival of Edward
might instantly be expected; whilst the powerful
co-operation of the Duke of Burgundy, and the
assistance of numerous disaffected French noblemen
in the provinces which had been so long
under the English dominion, threatened a fearful
issue of the war to Louis XI., sagacious, wise, and
powerful as that prince unquestionably was.</p>

<p>It would no doubt have been the wisest policy of
Charles of Burgundy, when thus engaging in an
alliance against his most formidable neighbour,
and hereditary as well as personal enemy, to have
avoided all cause of quarrel with the Helvetian
Confederacy, a poor but most warlike people, who
already had been taught by repeated successes to
feel that their hardy infantry could, if necessary,
engage on terms of equality, or even of advantage,
the flower of that chivalry which had hitherto
been considered as forming the strength of European
battle. But the measures of Charles, whom
fortune had opposed to the most astucious and
politic monarch of his time, were always dictated
by passionate feeling and impulse, rather than by
a judicious consideration of the circumstances in
which he stood. Haughty, proud, and uncompromising,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
though neither destitute of honour nor
generosity, he despised and hated what he termed
the paltry associations of herdsmen and shepherds,
united with a few towns which subsisted chiefly
by commerce; and instead of courting the Helvetian
Cantons, like his crafty enemy, or at least
affording them no ostensible pretence of quarrel,
he omitted no opportunity of showing the disregard
and contempt in which he held their upstart consequence,
and of evincing the secret longing which
he entertained to take vengeance upon them for
the quantity of noble blood which they had shed,
and to compensate the repeated successes they had
gained over the feudal lords, of whom he imagined
himself the destined avenger.</p>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy's possessions in the
Alsatian territory [<a href="#ednote_f" name="enanchor_f" id="enanchor_f" ><i>f</i></a>] afforded him many opportunities
for wreaking his displeasure upon the Swiss
League. The little castle and town of Ferette,
lying within ten or eleven miles of Bâle, served as
a thoroughfare to the traffic of Berne and Soleure,
the two principal towns of the confederation. In
this place the Duke posted a governor, or seneschal,
who was also an administrator of the revenue,
and seemed born on purpose to be the plague
and scourge of his republican neighbours.</p>

<p>Archibald von Hagenbach was a German noble,
whose possessions lay in Suabia, and was universally
esteemed one of the fiercest and most lawless
of that frontier nobility known by the name of
Robber-knights and Robber-counts. These dignitaries,
because they held their fiefs of the Holy
Roman Empire, claimed as complete sovereignty
within their territories of a mile square as any
reigning prince of Germany in his more extended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
dominions. They levied tolls and taxes on
strangers, and imprisoned, tried, and executed
those who, as they alleged, had committed offences
within their petty domains. But especially, and
in further exercise of their seignorial privileges,
they made war on each other, and on the Free
Cities of the Empire, attacking and plundering
without mercy the caravans, or large trains of
wagons, by which the internal commerce of Germany
was carried on.</p>

<p>A succession of injuries done and received by
Archibald of Hagenbach, who had been one of the
fiercest sticklers for this privilege of <i>faustrecht</i>, or
club-law, as it may be termed, had ended in his
being obliged, though somewhat advanced in life,
to leave a country where his tenure of existence
was become extremely precarious, and to engage
in the service of the Duke of Burgundy, who
willingly employed him, as he was a man of high
descent and proved valour, and not the less, perhaps,
that he was sure to find in a man of Hagenbach's
fierce, rapacious, and haughty disposition,
the unscrupulous executioner of whatsoever severities
it might be his master's pleasure to enjoin.</p>

<p>The traders of Berne and Soleure, accordingly,
made loud and violent complaints of Hagenbach's
exactions. The impositions laid on commodities
which passed through his district of La Ferette,
to whatever place they might be ultimately bound,
were arbitrarily increased, and the merchants and
traders who hesitated to make instant payment of
what was demanded were exposed to imprisonment
and personal punishment. The commercial towns
of Germany appealed to the Duke against this
iniquitous conduct on the part of the Governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
La Ferette, and requested of his Grace's goodness
that he would withdraw Von Hagenbach from
their neighbourhood; but the Duke treated their
complaints with contempt. The Swiss League
carried their remonstrances higher, and required
that justice should be done on the Governor of La
Ferette, as having offended against the law of
nations; but they were equally unable to attract
attention or obtain redress.</p>

<p>At length the Diet of the Confederation determined
to send the solemn deputation which has
been repeatedly mentioned. One or two of these
envoys joined with the calm and prudent Arnold
Biederman, in the hope that so solemn a measure
might open the eyes of the Duke to the wicked
injustice of his representative; others among the
deputies, having no such peaceful views, were
determined, by this resolute remonstrance, to pave
the way for hostilities.</p>

<p>Arnold Biederman was an especial advocate for
peace, while its preservation was compatible with
national independence, and the honour of the
Confederacy; but the younger Philipson soon discovered
that the Landamman alone, of all his
family, cherished these moderate views. The
opinion of his sons had been swayed and seduced
by the impetuous eloquence and overbearing influence
of Rudolph of Donnerhugel, who, by some
feats of peculiar gallantry, and the consideration
due to the merit of his ancestors, had acquired an
influence in the councils of his native canton, and
with the youth of the League in general, beyond
what was usually yielded by these wise republicans
to men of his early age. Arthur, who was
now an acceptable and welcome companion of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
their hunting parties and other sports, heard nothing
among the young men but anticipations of
war, rendered delightful by the hopes of booty and
of distinction, which were to be obtained by the
Switzers. The feats of their ancestors against
the Germans had been so wonderful as to realise
the fabulous victories of romance; and while the
present race possessed the same hardy limbs, and
the same inflexible courage, they eagerly anticipated
the same distinguished success. When the Governor
of La Ferette was mentioned in the conversation,
he was usually spoken of as the bandog of
Burgundy, or the Alsatian mastiff; and intimations
were openly given, that if his course were
not instantly checked by his master, and he himself
withdrawn from the frontiers of Switzerland,
Archibald of Hagenbach would find his fortress no
protection from the awakened indignation of the
wronged inhabitants of Soleure, and particularly
of those of Berne.</p>

<p>This general disposition to war among the young
Switzers was reported to the elder Philipson by
his son, and led him at one time to hesitate
whether he ought not rather to resume all the
inconveniences and dangers of a journey, accompanied
only by Arthur, than run the risk of the
quarrels in which he might be involved by the
unruly conduct of these fierce mountain youths,
after they should have left their own frontiers.
Such an event would have had, in a peculiar
degree, the effect of destroying every purpose of
his journey; but respected as Arnold Biederman
was by his family and countrymen, the English
merchant concluded, upon the whole, that his
influence would be able to restrain his companions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
until the great question of peace or war should
be determined, and especially until they should
have discharged their commission by obtaining an
audience of the Duke of Burgundy; and after this
he should be separated from their society, and not
liable to be engaged in any responsibility for their
ulterior measures.</p>

<p>After a delay of about ten days, the deputation
commissioned to remonstrate with the Duke on
the aggressions and exactions of Archibald of
Hagenbach at length assembled at Geierstein,
whence the members were to journey forth together.
They were three in number, besides the
young Bernese, and the Landamman of Unterwalden.
One was, like Arnold, a proprietor from
the Forest Cantons, wearing a dress scarcely handsomer
than that of a common herdsman, but distinguished
by the beauty and size of his long
silvery beard. His name was Nicholas Bonstetten.
Melchior Sturmthal, banner-bearer of Berne, a
man of middle age, and a soldier of distinguished
courage, with Adam Zimmerman, a burgess of
Soleure, who was considerably older, completed
the number of the envoys.</p>

<p>Each was dressed after his best fashion; but
notwithstanding that the severe eye of Arnold
Biederman censured one or two silver belt-buckles,
as well as a chain of the same metal, which decorated
the portly person of the burgess of Soleure,
it seemed that a powerful and victorious people,
for such the Swiss were now to be esteemed, were
never represented by an embassy of such patriarchal
simplicity. The deputies travelled on foot,
with their piked staves in their hands, like pilgrims
bound for some place of devotion. Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
mules, which bore their little stock of baggage,
were led by young lads, sons or cousins of members
of the embassy, who had obtained permission in
this manner to get such a glance of the world
beyond the mountains as this journey promised
to afford.</p>

<p>But although their retinue was small, so far as
respected either state or personal attendance and
accommodation, the dangerous circumstances of
the times, and the very unsettled state of the
country beyond their own territories, did not permit
men charged with affairs of such importance to
travel without a guard. Even the danger arising
from the wolves, which, when pinched by the
approach of winter, have been known to descend
from their mountain fastnesses into open villages,
such as those the travellers might choose to quarter
in, rendered the presence of some escort necessary;
and the bands of deserters from various services,
who formed parties of banditti on the frontiers of
Alsatia and Germany, combined to recommend
such a precaution.</p>

<p>Accordingly, about twenty of the selected youth
from the various Swiss cantons, including Rudiger,
Ernest, and Sigismund, Arnold's three eldest sons,
attended upon the deputation. They did not, however,
observe any military order, or march close
or near to the patriarchal train. On the contrary,
they formed hunting parties of five or six together,
who explored the rocks, woods, and passes of the
mountains, through which the envoys journeyed.
Their slower pace allowed the active young men,
who were accompanied by their large shaggy dogs,
full time to destroy wolves and bears, or occasionally
to surprise a chamois among the cliffs; while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the hunters, even while in pursuit of their sport,
were careful to examine such places as might
afford opportunity for ambush, and thus ascertained
the safety of the party whom they escorted, more
securely than if they had attended close on their
train. A peculiar note on the huge Swiss bugle,
before described, formed of the horn of the mountain
bull, was the signal agreed upon for collecting
in a body should danger occur. Rudolph
Donnerhugel, so much younger than his brethren
in the same important commission, took the command
of this mountain body-guard, whom he
usually accompanied in their sportive excursions.
In point of arms, they were well provided; bearing
two-handed swords, long partisans and spears,
as well as both cross and long bows, short cutlasses,
and huntsmen's knives. The heavier
weapons, as impeding their activity, were carried
with the baggage, but were ready to be assumed
on the slightest alarm.</p>

<p>Arthur Philipson, like his late antagonist, naturally
preferred the company and sports of the
younger men to the grave conversation and slow
pace of the fathers of the mountain commonwealth.
There was, however, one temptation to loiter with
the baggage, which, had other circumstances permitted,
might have reconciled the young Englishman
to forego the opportunities of sport which the
Swiss youth so eagerly sought after, and endure
the slow pace and grave conversation of the elders
of the party. In a word, Anne of Geierstein,
accompanied by a Swiss girl her attendant, travelled
in the rear of the deputation.</p>

<p>The two females were mounted upon asses,
whose slow step hardly kept pace with the baggage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
mules; and it may be fairly suspected that Arthur
Philipson, in requital of the important services
which he had received from that beautiful and
interesting young woman, would have deemed it
no extreme hardship to have afforded her occasionally
his assistance on the journey, and the advantage
of his conversation to relieve the tediousness
of the way. But he dared not presume to offer
attentions which the customs of the country did
not seem to permit, since they were not attempted
by any of the maiden's cousins, or even by
Rudolph Donnerhugel, who certainly had hitherto
appeared to neglect no opportunity to recommend
himself to his fair cousin. Besides, Arthur had
reflection enough to be convinced, that in yielding
to the feelings which impelled him to cultivate
the acquaintance of this amiable young person, he
would certainly incur the serious displeasure of
his father, and probably also that of her uncle, by
whose hospitality they had profited, and whose
safe-conduct they were in the act of enjoying.</p>

<p>The young Englishman, therefore, pursued the
same amusements which interested the other young
men of the party, managing only, as frequently as
their halts permitted, to venture upon offering to
the maiden such marks of courtesy as could afford
no room for remark or censure. And his character
as a sportsman being now well established, he
sometimes permitted himself, even when the game
was afoot, to loiter in the vicinity of the path on
which he could at least mark the flutter of the
grey wimple of Anne of Geierstein, and the outline
of the form which it shrouded. This indolence,
as it seemed, was not unfavourably construed by
his companions, being only accounted an indifference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to the less noble or less dangerous game; for
when the object was a bear, wolf, or other animal
of prey, no spear, cutlass, or bow of the party,
not even those of Rudolph Donnerhugel, were so
prompt in the chase as those of the young
Englishman.</p>

<p>Meantime, the elder Philipson had other and
more serious subjects of consideration. He was a
man, as the reader must have already seen, of much
acquaintance with the world, in which he had
acted parts different from that which he now sustained.
Former feelings were recalled and awakened,
by the view of sports familiar to his early
years. The clamour of the hounds, echoing from
the wild hills and dark forests through which they
travelled; the sight of the gallant young huntsmen,
appearing, as they brought the object of
their chase to bay, amid airy cliffs and profound
precipices, which seemed impervious to the human
foot; the sounds of halloo and horn reverberating
from hill to hill, had more than once well-nigh
impelled him to take a share in the hazardous but
animating amusement, which, next to war, was
then in most parts of Europe the most serious
occupation of life. But the feeling was transient,
and he became yet more deeply interested in studying
the manners and opinions of the persons with
whom he was travelling.</p>

<p>They seemed to be all coloured with the same
downright and blunt simplicity which characterised
Arnold Biederman, although it was in
none of them elevated by the same dignity of
thought or profound sagacity. In speaking of the
political state of their country, they affected no
secrecy; and although, with the exception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Rudolph, their own young men were not admitted
into their councils, the exclusion seemed only
adopted with a view to the necessary subordination
of youth to age, and not for the purpose of
observing any mystery. In the presence of the
elder Philipson, they freely discussed the pretensions
of the Duke of Burgundy, the means which
their country possessed of maintaining her independence,
and the firm resolution of the Helvetian
League to bid defiance to the utmost force the
world could bring against it, rather than submit
to the slightest insult. In other respects, their
views appeared wise and moderate, although both
the Banneret of Berne and the consequential Burgher
of Soleure seemed to hold the consequences
of war more lightly than they were viewed by
the cautious Landamman of Unterwalden, and his
venerable companion, Nicholas Bonstetten, who
subscribed to all his opinions.</p>

<p>It frequently happened that, quitting these subjects,
the conversation turned on such as were less
attractive to their fellow-traveller. The signs of
the weather, the comparative fertility of recent
seasons, the most advantageous mode of managing
their orchards and rearing their crops, though
interesting to the mountaineers themselves, gave
Philipson slender amusement; and notwithstanding
that the excellent Meinherr Zimmerman of
Soleure would fain have joined with him in conversation
respecting trade and merchandise, yet
the Englishman, who dealt in articles of small
bulk and considerable value, and traversed sea and
land to carry on his traffic, could find few mutual
topics to discuss with the Swiss trader, whose
commerce only extended into the neighbouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
districts of Burgundy and Germany, and whose
goods consisted of coarse woollen cloths, fustian,
hides, peltry, and such ordinary articles.</p>

<p>But ever and anon, while the Switzers were
discussing some paltry interests of trade, or describing
some process of rude cultivation, or speaking
of blights in grain, and the murrain amongst
cattle, with all the dull minuteness of petty
farmers and traders met at a country fair, a well-known
spot would recall the name and story of a
battle in which some of them had served (for there
were none of the party who had not been repeatedly
in arms), and the military details, which
in other countries were only the theme of knights
and squires who had acted their part in them, or
of learned clerks who laboured to record them,
were, in this singular region, the familiar and
intimate subjects of discussion with men whose
peaceful occupations seemed to place them at an
immeasurable distance from the profession of a
soldier. This led the Englishman to think of the
ancient inhabitants of Rome, where the plough
was so readily exchanged for the sword, and the
cultivation of a rude farm for the management of
public affairs. He hinted this resemblance to the
Landamman, who was naturally gratified with the
compliment to his country, but presently replied&mdash;"May
Heaven continue among us the homebred
virtues of the Romans, and preserve us from their
lust of conquest and love of foreign luxuries!"</p>

<p>The slow pace of the travellers, with various
causes of delay which it is unnecessary to dwell
upon, occasioned the deputation spending two
nights on the road before they reached Bâle. The
small towns or villages in which they quartered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
received them with such marks of respectful hospitality
as they had the means to bestow, and their
arrival was a signal for a little feast, with which
the heads of the community uniformly regaled
them.</p>

<p>On such occasions, while the elders of the village
entertained the deputies of the Confederation,
the young men of the escort were provided for by
those of their own age, several of whom, usually
aware of their approach, were accustomed to join
in the chase of the day, and made the strangers
acquainted with the spots where game was most
plenty.</p>

<p>These feasts were never prolonged to excess, and
the most special dainties which composed them
were kids, lambs, and game, the produce of the
mountains. Yet it seemed, both to Arthur Philipson
and his father, that the advantages of good
cheer were more prized by the Banneret of Berne
and the Burgess of Soleure than by their host the
Landamman and the Deputy of Schwitz. There
was no excess committed, as we have already said;
but the deputies first mentioned obviously understood
the art of selecting the choicest morsels, and
were connoisseurs in the good wine, chiefly of
foreign growth, with which they freely washed it
down. Arnold was too wise to censure what he
had no means of amending: he contented himself
by observing in his own person a rigorous diet,
living indeed almost entirely upon vegetables and
fair water, in which he was closely imitated by
the old grey-bearded Nicholas Bonstetten, who
seemed to make it his principal object to follow
the Landamman's example in everything.</p>

<p>It was, as we have already said, the third day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
after the commencement of their journey, before
the Swiss deputation reached the vicinity of Bâle,
in which city, then one of the largest in the
south-western extremity of Germany, they proposed
taking up their abode for the evening, nothing
doubting a friendly reception. The town, it is
true, was not then, nor till about thirty years afterwards,
a part of the Swiss Confederation, to which
it was only joined in 1501; but it was a Free
Imperial City, connected with Berne, Soleure,
Lucerne, and other towns of Switzerland by
mutual interests and constant intercourse. It was
the object of the deputation to negotiate, if possible,
a peace, which could not be more useful to
themselves than to the city of Bâle, considering
the interruptions of commerce which must be occasioned
by a rupture between the Duke of Burgundy
and the Cantons, and the great advantage which
that city would derive by preserving a neutrality,
situated as it was betwixt these two hostile
powers.</p>

<p>They anticipated, therefore, as welcome a reception
from the authorities of Bâle as they had
received while in the bounds of their own Confederation,
since the interests of that city were so
deeply concerned in the objects of their mission.
The next chapter will show how far these expectations
were realised.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>They saw that city, welcoming the Rhine,</p>
<p>As from his mountain heritage he bursts,</p>
<p>As purposed proud Orgetorix of yore,</p>
<p>Leaving the desert region of the hills,</p>
<p>To lord it o'er the fertile plains of Gaul.</p>

<p class="i16"><i>Helvetia.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The eyes of the English travellers, wearied with
a succession of wild mountainous scenery, now
gazed with pleasure upon a country still indeed
irregular and hilly in its surface, but capable of
high cultivation, and adorned with cornfields and
vineyards. The Rhine, a broad and large river,
poured its grey stream in a huge sweep through
the landscape, and divided into two portions the
city of Bâle, which is situated on its banks. The
southern part, to which the path of the Swiss
deputies conducted them, displayed the celebrated
cathedral, and the lofty terrace which runs in
front of it, and seemed to remind the travellers that
they now approached a country in which the operations
of man could make themselves distinguished
even among the works of nature, instead of being
lost, as the fate of the most splendid efforts of
human labour must have been, among those
tremendous mountains which they had so lately
traversed.</p>

<p>They were yet a mile from the entrance of the
city, when the party was met by one of the magistrates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
attended by two or three citizens mounted
on mules, the velvet housings of which expressed
wealth and quality. They greeted the Landamman
of Unterwalden and his party in a respectful
manner, and the latter prepared themselves to
hear, and make a suitable reply to, the hospitable
invitation which they naturally expected to
receive.</p>

<p>The message of the community of Bâle was,
however, diametrically opposite to what they had
anticipated. It was delivered with a good deal of
diffidence and hesitation by the functionary who
met them, and who certainly, while discharging
his commission, did not appear to consider it as
the most respectable which he might have borne.
There were many professions of the most profound
and fraternal regard for the cities of the Helvetian
League, with whom the orator of Bâle declared his
own state to be united in friendship and interests.
But he ended by intimating, that, on account of
certain cogent and weighty reasons, which should
be satisfactorily explained at more leisure, the
Free City of Bâle could not, this evening, receive
within its walls the highly respected deputies,
who were travelling, at the command of the Helvetian
Diet, to the court of the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Philipson marked with much interest the effect
which this most unexpected intimation produced
on the members of the embassage. Rudolph Donnerhugel,
who had joined their company as they
approached Bâle, appeared less surprised than his
associates, and, while he remained perfectly silent,
seemed rather anxious to penetrate their sentiments
than disposed to express his own. It was
not the first time the sagacious merchant had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
observed that this bold and fiery young man could,
when his purposes required it, place a strong constraint
upon the natural impetuosity of his temper.
For the others, the Banneret's brow darkened; the
face of the Burgess of Soleure became flushed like
the moon when rising in the north-west; the grey-bearded
Deputy of Schwitz looked anxiously on
Arnold Biederman; and the Landamman himself
seemed more moved than was usual in a person of
his equanimity. At length he replied to the functionary
of Bâle, in a voice somewhat altered by
his feelings:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is a singular message to the deputies of
the Swiss Confederacy, bound as we are upon an
amicable mission, on which depends the interest of
the good citizens of Bâle, whom we have always
treated as our good friends, and who still profess
to be so. The shelter of their roofs, the protection
of their walls, the wonted intercourse of hospitality,
is what no friendly state hath a right to
refuse to the inhabitants of another."</p>

<p>"Nor is it with their will that the community
of Bâle refuse it, worthy Landamman," replied the
magistrate. "Not you alone, and your worthy
associates, but your escort, and your very beasts
of burden, should be entertained with all the kindness
which the citizens of Bâle could bestow&mdash;But
we act under constraint."</p>

<p>"And by whom exercised?" said the Banneret,
bursting out into passion. "Has the Emperor
Sigismund profited so little by the example of his
predecessors"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Emperor," replied the delegate of Bâle, interrupting
the Banneret, "is a well-intentioned and
peaceful monarch, as he has been ever; but&mdash;&mdash;there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
are Burgundian troops, of late marched into
the Sundgaw, and messages have been sent to our
state from Count Archibald of Hagenbach."</p>

<p>"Enough said," replied the Landamman. "Draw
not farther the veil from a weakness for which you
blush. I comprehend you entirely. Bâle lies too
near the citadel of La Ferette to permit its citizens
to consult their own inclinations. Brother, we
see where your difficulty lies&mdash;we pity you&mdash;and
we forgive your inhospitality."</p>

<p>"Nay, but hear me to an end, worthy Landamman,"
answered the magistrate. "There is here
in the vicinity an old hunting-seat of the Counts
of Falkenstein, called Graffs-lust,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which, though
ruinous, yet may afford better lodgings than the
open air, and is capable of some defence&mdash;though
Heaven forbid that any one should dare to intrude
upon your repose! And hark ye hither,
my worthy friends;&mdash;if you find in the old place
some refreshments, as wine, beer, and the like, use
them without scruple, for they are there for your
accommodation."</p>

<p>"I do not refuse to occupy a place of security,"
said the Landamman; "for although the causing
us to be excluded from Bâle may be only done in
the spirit of petty insolence and malice, yet it
may also, for what we can tell, be connected with
some purpose of violence. Your provisions we
thank you for; but we will not, with my consent,
feed at the cost of friends who are ashamed to
own us unless by stealth."</p>

<p>"One thing more, my worthy sir," said the
official of Bâle&mdash;"You have a maiden in company,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
who, I presume to think, is your daughter.
There is but rough accommodation where you are
going, even for men;&mdash;for women there is little
better, though what we could we have done to
arrange matters as well as may be. But rather
let your daughter go with us back to Bâle,
where my dame will be a mother to her, till next
morning, when I will bring her to your camp in
safety. We promised to shut our gates against
the men of the Confederacy, but the women were
not mentioned."</p>

<p>"You are subtle casuists, you men of Bâle,"
answered the Landamman; "but know, that from
the time in which the Helvetians sallied forth to
encounter Cæsar down to the present hour, the
women of Switzerland, in the press of danger,
have had their abode in the camp of their fathers,
brothers, and husbands, and sought no further
safety than they might find in the courage of their
relations. We have enough of men to protect our
women, and my niece shall remain with us, and
take the fate which Heaven may send us."</p>

<p>"Adieu, then, worthy friend," said the magistrate
of Bâle; "it grieves me to part with you
thus, but evil fate will have it so. Yonder grassy
avenue will conduct you to the old hunting-seat,
where Heaven send that you may pass a quiet
night; for, apart from other risks, men say that
these ruins have no good name. Will you yet
permit your niece, since such the young person is,
to pass to Bâle for the night in my company?"</p>

<p>"If we are disturbed by beings like ourselves,"
said Arnold Biederman, "we have strong arms,
and heavy partisans; if we should be visited, as
your words would imply, by those of a different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
description, we have, or should have, good consciences,
and confidence in Heaven.&mdash;Good friends,
my brethren on this embassy, have I spoken your
sentiments as well as mine own?"</p>

<p>The other deputies intimated their assent to
what their companion had said, and the citizens
of Bâle took a courteous farewell of their guests,
endeavouring, by the excess of civility, to atone
for their deficiency in effective hospitality. After
their departure, Rudolph was the first to express
his sense of their pusillanimous behaviour, on
which he had been silent during their presence.
"Coward dogs!" he said; "may the Butcher of
Burgundy flay the very skins from them with his
exactions, to teach them to disown old friendships,
rather than abide the lightest blast of a tyrant's
anger!"</p>

<p>"And not even their own tyrant either," said
another of the group&mdash;for several of the young
men had gathered round their seniors, to hear the
welcome which they expected from the magistrates
of Bâle.</p>

<p>"No," replied Ernest, one of Arnold Biederman's
sons, "they do not pretend that their own
prince the Emperor hath interfered with them;
but a word of the Duke of Burgundy, which should
be no more to them than a breath of wind from
the west, is sufficient to stir them to such brutal
inhospitality. It were well to march to the city,
and compel them at the sword's point to give us
shelter."</p>

<p>A murmur of applause arose amongst the youth
around, which awakened the displeasure of Arnold
Biederman.</p>

<p>"Did I hear," he said, "the tongue of a son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
mine, or was it that of a brutish Lanzknecht,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who
has no pleasure but in battle or violence? Where
is the modesty of the youth of Switzerland, who
were wont to wait the signal for action till it
pleased the elders of the canton to give it, and
were as gentle as maidens till the voice of their
patriarchs bade them be bold as lions?"</p>

<p>"I meant no harm, father," said Ernest, abashed
with this rebuke, "far less any slight towards you;
but I must needs say"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say not a word, my son," replied Arnold, "but
leave our camp to-morrow by break of day; and, as
thou takest thy way back to Geierstein, to which
I command thine instant return, remember, that he
is not fit to visit strange countries who cannot rule
his tongue before his own countrymen, and to his
own father."</p>

<p>The Banneret of Berne, the Burgess of Soleure,
even the long-bearded Deputy from Schwitz, endeavoured
to intercede for the offender, and obtain
a remission of his banishment; but it was in
vain.</p>

<p>"No, my good friends and brethren, no," replied
Arnold. "These young men require an example;
and though I am grieved in one sense that the
offence has chanced within my own family, yet I
am pleased in another light, that the delinquent
should be one over whom I can exercise full authority,
without suspicion of partiality.&mdash;Ernest,
my son, thou hast heard my commands: Return
to Geierstein with the morning's light, and let me
find thee an altered man when I return thither."</p>

<p>The young Swiss, who was evidently much hurt
and shocked at this public affront, placed one knee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
on the ground, and kissed his father's right hand,
while Arnold, without the slightest sign of anger,
bestowed his blessing upon him; and Ernest,
without a word of remonstrance, fell into the rear
of the party. The deputation then proceeded down
the avenue which had been pointed out to them,
and at the bottom of which arose the massy ruins
of Graffs-lust; but there was not enough of daylight
remaining to discern their exact form. They
could observe as they drew nearer, and as the night
became darker, that three or four windows were
lighted up, while the rest of the front remained
obscured in gloom. When they arrived at the
place, they perceived it was surrounded by a large
and deep moat, the sullen surface of which reflected,
though faintly, the glimmer of the lights
within.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>Francisco.</i><span class="i2">Give you good-night.</span></p>
<p><i>Marcellus.</i> <span class="i2">O, farewell, honest soldier.</span></p>
<p class="i7">Who hath relieved you?</p>

<p><i>Francisco.</i> <span class="i2">Give you good-night; Bernardo hath my place.</span></p>

<p class="i16"><i>Hamlet.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The first occupation of our travellers was to find
the means of crossing the moat, and they were not
long of discovering the <i>tête de pont</i> on which the
drawbridge, when lowered, had formerly rested.
The bridge itself had been long decayed, but a
temporary passage of fir-trees and planks had been
constructed, apparently very lately, which admitted
them to the chief entrance of the castle.
On entering it, they found a wicket opening under
the archway, which, glimmering with light, served
to guide them to a hall prepared evidently for
their accommodation as well as circumstances had
admitted of.</p>

<p>A large fire of well-seasoned wood burned
blithely in the chimney, and had been maintained
so long there, that the air of the hall, notwithstanding
its great size and somewhat ruinous
aspect, felt mild and genial. There was also at
the end of the apartment a stack of wood, large
enough to maintain the fire had they been to remain
there a week. Two or three long tables in
the hall stood covered and ready for their reception;
and, on looking more closely, several large
hampers were found in a corner, containing cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
provisions of every kind, prepared with great care,
for their immediate use. The eyes of the good
Burgess of Soleure twinkled when he beheld the
young men in the act of transferring the supper
from the hampers and arranging it on the table.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "these poor men of Bâle have
saved their character; since, if they have fallen
short in welcome, they have abounded in good
cheer."</p>

<p>"Ah, friend!" said Arnold Biederman, "the
absence of the landlord is a great deduction from
the entertainment. Better half an apple from the
hand of your host, than a bridal feast without his
company."</p>

<p>"We owe them the less for their banquet," said
the Banneret. "But, from the doubtful language
they held, I should judge it meet to keep a strong
guard to-night, and even that some of our young
men should, from time to time, patrol around the
old ruins. The place is strong and defensible, and
so far our thanks are due to those who have acted
as our quarter-masters. We will, however, with
your permission, my honoured brethren, examine
the house within, and then arrange regular guards
and patrols.&mdash;To your duty then, young men, and
search these ruins carefully,&mdash;they may perchance
contain more than ourselves; for we are now near
one who, like a pilfering fox, moves more willingly
by night than by day, and seeks his prey
amidst ruins and wildernesses rather than in the
open field."</p>

<p>All agreed to this proposal. The young men
took torches, of which a good provision had been
left for their use, and made a strict search through
the ruins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>The greater part of the castle was much more
wasted and ruinous than the portion which the
citizens of Bâle seemed to have destined for the
accommodation of the embassy. Some parts were
roofless, and the whole desolate. The glare of
light&mdash;the gleam of arms&mdash;the sound of the
human voice, and echoes of mortal tread, startled
from their dark recesses bats, owls, and other birds
of ill omen, the usual inhabitants of such time-worn
edifices, whose flight through the desolate
chambers repeatedly occasioned alarm amongst
those who heard the noise without seeing the
cause, and shouts of laughter when it became
known. They discovered that the deep moat surrounded
their place of retreat on all sides, and of
course that they were in safety against any attack
which could be made from without, except it was
attempted by the main entrance, which it was
easy to barricade, and guard with sentinels. They
also ascertained by strict search, that though it
was possible an individual might be concealed
amid such a waste of ruins, yet it was altogether
impossible that any number which might be formidable
to so large a party as their own could
have remained there without a certainty of discovery.
These particulars were reported to the Banneret,
who directed Donnerhugel to take charge of
a body of six of the young men, such as he should
himself choose, to patrol on the outside of the
building till the first cock-crowing, and at that
hour to return to the castle, when the same number
were to take the duty till morning dawned,
and then be relieved in their turn. Rudolph
declared his own intention to remain on guard the
whole night; and as he was equally remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
for vigilance as for strength and courage, the external
watch was considered as safely provided
for, it being settled that, in case of any sudden
reencounter, the deep and hoarse sound of the Swiss
bugle should be the signal for sending support to
the patrolling party.</p>

<p>Within side the castle the precautions were
taken with equal vigilance. A sentinel, to be
relieved every two hours, was appointed to take
post at the principal gate, and other two kept
watch on the other side of the castle, although the
moat appeared to insure safety in that quarter.</p>

<p>These precautions being taken, the remainder of
the party sat down to refresh themselves, the
deputies occupying the upper part of the hall,
while those of their escort modestly arranged
themselves in the lower end of the same large
apartment. Quantities of hay and straw, which
were left piled in the wide castle, were put to the
purpose for which undoubtedly they had been
destined by the citizens of Bâle, and, with the aid
of cloaks and mantles, were judged excellent good
bedding by a hardy race, who, in war or the chase,
were often well satisfied with a much worse
night's lair.</p>

<p>The attention of the Bâlese had even gone so
far as to provide for Anne of Geierstein separate
accommodation, more suitable to her use than that
assigned to the men of the party. An apartment,
which had probably been the buttery of the castle,
entered from the hall, and had also a doorway
leading out into a passage connected with the
ruins; but this last had hastily, yet carefully,
been built up with large hewn stones taken from
the ruins; without mortar, indeed, or any other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
cement, but so well secured by their own weight,
that an attempt to displace them must have
alarmed not only any one who might be in the
apartment itself, but also those who were in the
hall adjacent, or indeed in any part of the castle.
In the small room thus carefully arranged and
secured there were two pallet-beds and a large fire,
which blazed on the hearth, and gave warmth and
comfort to the apartment. Even the means of
devotion were not forgotten, a small crucifix of
bronze being hung over a table, on which lay a
breviary.</p>

<p>Those who first discovered this little place of
retreat came back loud in praise of the delicacy of
the citizens of Bâle, who, while preparing for the
general accommodation of the strangers, had not
failed to provide separately and peculiarly for that
of their female companion.</p>

<p>Arnold Biederman felt the kindness of this conduct.
"We should pity our friends of Bâle, and
not nourish resentment against them," he said.
"They have stretched their kindness towards us
as far as their personal apprehensions permitted;
and that is saying no small matter for them, my
masters, for no passion is so unutterably selfish as
that of fear.&mdash;Anne, my love, thou art fatigued.
Go to the retreat provided for you, and Lizette
shall bring you from this abundant mass of provisions
what will be fittest for your evening meal."</p>

<p>So saying, he led his niece into the little bedroom,
and, looking round with an air of complacency,
wished her good repose; but there was
something on the maiden's brow which seemed to
augur that her uncle's wishes would not be fulfilled.
From the moment she had left Switzerland, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
looks had become clouded; her intercourse with
those who approached her had grown more brief
and rare; her whole appearance was marked with
secret anxiety or secret sorrow. This did not
escape her uncle, who naturally imputed it to the
pain of parting from him, which was probably
soon to take place, and to her regret at leaving the
tranquil spot in which so many years of her youth
had been spent.</p>

<p>But Anne of Geierstein had no sooner entered
the apartment than her whole frame trembled violently,
and the colour leaving her cheeks entirely,
she sank down on one of the pallets, where, resting
her elbows on her knees, and pressing her
hands on her forehead, she rather resembled a
person borne down by mental distress, or oppressed
by some severe illness, than one who, tired with a
journey, was in haste to betake herself to needful
rest. Arnold was not quicksighted as to the many
sources of female passion. He saw that his niece
suffered; but imputing it only to the causes already
mentioned, augmented by the hysterical effects
often produced by fatigue, he gently blamed her
for having departed from her character of a Swiss
maiden ere she was yet out of reach of a Swiss
breeze of wind.</p>

<p>"Thou must not let the dames of Germany or
Flanders think that our daughters have degenerated
from their mothers; else must we fight the
battles of Sempach and Laupen over again, to convince
the Emperor, and this haughty Duke of
Burgundy, that our men are of the same mettle
with their forefathers. And as for our parting,
I do not fear it. My brother is a Count of
the Empire, indeed, and therefore he must needs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
satisfy himself that everything over which he possesses
any title shall be at his command, and sends
for thee to prove his right of doing so. But I
know him well: He will no sooner be satisfied
that he may command thy attendance at pleasure,
than he will concern himself about thee no more.
Thee? Alas! poor thing, in what couldst thou
aid his courtly intrigues and ambitious plans?
No, no&mdash;thou art not for the noble Count's purpose,
and must be content to trudge back to rule
the dairy at Geierstein, and be the darling of
thine old peasantlike uncle."</p>

<p>"Would to God we were there even now!" said
the maiden, in a tone of wretchedness which she
strove in vain to conceal or suppress.</p>

<p>"That may hardly be till we have executed the
purpose which brought us hither," said the literal
Landamman. "But lay thee on thy pallet, Anne&mdash;take
a morsel of food, and three drops of wine,
and thou wilt wake to-morrow as gay as on a Swiss
holiday, when the pipe sounds the réveille."</p>

<p>Anne was now able to plead a severe headache,
and declining all refreshment, which she declared
herself incapable of tasting, she bade her uncle
good-night. She then desired Lizette to get some
food for herself, cautioning her, as she returned,
to make as little noise as possible, and not to break
her repose if she should have the good fortune to
fall asleep. Arnold Biederman then kissed his
niece, and returned to the hall, where his colleagues
in office were impatient to commence an
attack on the provisions which were in readiness;
to which the escort of young men, diminished by
the patrols and sentinels, were no less disposed
than their seniors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>The signal of assault was given by the Deputy
from Schwitz, the eldest of the party, pronouncing
in patriarchal form a benediction over the meal.
The travellers then commenced their operations
with a vivacity which showed that the uncertainty
whether they should get any food, and the delays
which had occurred in arranging themselves in
their quarters, had infinitely increased their appetites.
Even the Landamman, whose moderation
sometimes approached to abstinence, seemed that
night in a more genial humour than ordinary.
His friend of Schwitz, after his example, ate,
drank, and spoke more than usual; while the rest
of the deputies pushed their meal to the verge of a
carousal. The elder Philipson marked the scene
with an attentive and anxious eye, confining his
applications to the wine-cup to such pledges as the
politeness of the times called upon him to reply
to. His son had left the hall just as the banquet
began, in the manner which we are now to relate.</p>

<p>Arthur had proposed to himself to join the
youths who were to perform the duty of sentinels
within, or patrols on the outside of their place of
repose, and had indeed made some arrangement for
that purpose with Sigismund, the third of the
Landamman's sons. But while about to steal a
parting glance at Anne of Geierstein, before offering
his service as he proposed, there appeared on
her brow such a deep and solemn expression, as
diverted his thoughts from every other subject,
excepting the anxious doubts as to what could
possibly have given rise to such a change. The
placid openness of brow; the eye which expressed
conscious and fearless innocence; the lips which,
seconded by a look as frank as her words, seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
ever ready to speak, in kindness and in confidence,
that which the heart dictated, were for the moment
entirely changed in character and expression, and
in a degree and manner for which no ordinary
cause could satisfactorily account. Fatigue might
have banished the rose from the maiden's beautiful
complexion, and sickness or pain might have
dimmed her eye and clouded her brow. But the
look of deep dejection with which she fixed her
eyes at times on the ground, and the startled and
terrified glance which she cast around her at other
intervals, must have had their rise in some different
source. Neither could illness or weariness
explain the manner in which her lips were contracted
or compressed together, like one who
makes up her mind to act or behold something
that is fearful, or account for the tremor which
seemed at times to steal over her insensibly,
though by a strong effort she was able at intervals
to throw it off. For this change of expression
there must be in the heart some deeply melancholy
and afflicting cause. What could that cause be?</p>

<p>It is dangerous for youth to behold beauty in
the pomp of all her charms, with every look bent
upon conquest&mdash;more dangerous to see her in the
hour of unaffected and unapprehensive ease and
simplicity, yielding herself to the graceful whim
of the moment, and as willing to be pleased as
desirous of pleasing. There are minds which
may be still more affected by gazing on beauty in
sorrow, and feeling that pity, that desire of comforting
the lovely mourner, which the poet has
described as so nearly akin to love. But to a
spirit of that romantic and adventurous cast which
the Middle Ages frequently produced, the sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
a young and amiable person evidently in a state of
terror and suffering, which had no visible cause,
was perhaps still more impressive than beauty, in
her pride, her tenderness, or her sorrow. Such
sentiments, it must be remembered, were not confined
to the highest ranks only, but might then be
found in all classes of society which were raised
above the mere peasant or artisan. Young Philipson
gazed on Anne of Geierstein with such intense
curiosity, mingled with pity and tenderness, that
the bustling scene around him seemed to vanish
from his eyes, and leave no one in the noisy hall
save himself and the object of his interest.</p>

<p>What could it be that so evidently oppressed
and almost quailed a spirit so well balanced, and
a courage so well tempered, when, being guarded
by the swords of the bravest men perhaps to be
found in Europe, and lodged in a place of strength,
even the most timid of her sex might have found
confidence? Surely if an attack were to be made
upon them, the clamour of a conflict in such circumstances
could scarce be more terrific than the
roar of those cataracts which he had seen her despise?
At least, he thought, she ought to be aware
that there is one, who is bound by friendship and
gratitude to fight to the death in her defence.
Would to Heaven, he continued in the same
reverie, it were possible to convey to her, without
sign or speech, the assurance of my unalterable
resolution to protect her in the worst of perils!&mdash;As
such thoughts streamed through his mind, Anne
raised her eyes in one of those fits of deep feeling
which seemed to overwhelm her; and, while she
cast them round the hall, with a look of apprehension,
as if she expected to see amid the well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
companions of her journey some strange
and unwelcome apparition, they encountered the
fixed and anxious gaze of young Philipson. They
were instantly bent on the ground, while a deep
blush showed how much she was conscious of
having attracted his attention by her previous
deportment.</p>

<p>Arthur, on his part, with equal consciousness,
blushed as deeply as the maiden herself, and drew
himself back from her observation. But when
Anne rose up, and was escorted by her uncle to
her bedchamber, in the manner we have already
mentioned, it seemed to Philipson as if she had
carried with her from the apartment the lights
with which it was illuminated, and left it in the
twilight melancholy of some funeral hall. His
deep musings were pursuing the subject which
occupied them thus anxiously, when the manly
voice of Donnerhugel spoke close in his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"What, comrade, has our journey to-day fatigued
you so much that you go to sleep upon your feet?"</p>

<p>"Now Heaven forbid, Hauptman," said the Englishman,
starting from his reverie, and addressing
Rudolph by this name (signifying Captain, or literally
Head-man), which the youth of the expedition
had by unanimous consent bestowed on him,&mdash;"Heaven
forbid I should sleep, if there be aught
like action in the wind."</p>

<p>"Where dost thou propose to be at cock-crow?"
said the Swiss.</p>

<p>"Where duty shall call me, or your experience,
noble Hauptman, shall appoint," replied Arthur.
"But, with your leave, I purposed to take Sigismund's
guard on the bridge till midnight or
morning dawn. He still feels the sprain which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
received in his spring after yonder chamois, and I
persuaded him to take some uninterrupted rest, as
the best mode of restoring his strength."</p>

<p>"He will do well to keep his counsel, then,"
again whispered Donnerhugel; "the old Landamman
is not a man to make allowances for mishaps,
when they interfere with duty. Those who are
under his orders should have as few brains as a
bull, as strong limbs as a bear, and be as impassible
as lead or iron to all the casualties of life,
and all the weaknesses of humanity."</p>

<p>Arthur replied in the same tone: "I have been
the Landamman's guest for some time, and have
seen no specimens of any such rigid discipline."</p>

<p>"You are a stranger," said the Swiss, "and the
old man has too much hospitality to lay you under
the least restraint. You are a volunteer, too, in
whatever share you choose to take in our sports or
our military duty; and therefore, when I ask you
to walk abroad with me at the first cock-crowing,
it is only in the event that such exercise shall
entirely consist with your own pleasure."</p>

<p>"I consider myself as under your command for
the time," said Philipson; "but, not to bandy
courtesy, at cock-crow I shall be relieved from my
watch on the drawbridge, and will be by that time
glad to exchange the post for a more extended
walk."</p>

<p>"Do you not choose more of this fatiguing, and
probably unnecessary duty, than may befit your
strength?" said Rudolph.</p>

<p>"I take no more than you do," said Arthur,
"as you propose not to take rest till morning."</p>

<p>"True," answered Donnerhugel, "but I am a
Swiss."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"And I," answered Philipson quickly, "am an
Englishman."</p>

<p>"I did not mean what I said in the sense you
take it," said Rudolph, laughing; "I only meant,
that I am more interested in this matter than you
can be, who are a stranger to the cause in which
we are personally engaged."</p>

<p>"I am a stranger, no doubt," replied Arthur;
"but a stranger who has enjoyed your hospitality,
and who, therefore, claims a right, while with
you, to a share in your labours and dangers."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said Rudolph Donnerhugel. "I
shall have finished my first rounds at the hour
when the sentinels at the castle are relieved, and
shall be ready to recommence them in your good
company."</p>

<p>"Content," said the Englishman. "And now I
will to my post, for I suspect Sigismund is blaming
me already, as oblivious of my promise."</p>

<p>They hastened together to the gate, where Sigismund
willingly yielded up his weapon and his
guard to young Philipson, confirming the idea
sometimes entertained of him, that he was the
most indolent and least spirited of the family of
Geierstein. Rudolph could not suppress his displeasure.</p>

<p>"What would the Landamman say," he demanded,
"if he saw thee thus quietly yield up
post and partisan to a stranger?"</p>

<p>"He would say I did well," answered the young
man, nothing daunted; "for he is for ever reminding
us to let the stranger have his own way in
everything; and English Arthur stands on this
bridge by his own wish, and no asking of mine.&mdash;Therefore,
kind Arthur, since thou wilt barter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
warm straw and a sound sleep for frosty air and a
clear moonlight, I make thee welcome with all my
heart. Hear your duty. You are to stop all who
enter, or attempt to enter, or till they give the
password. If they are strangers, you must give
alarm. But you will suffer such of our friends as
are known to you to pass outwards, without challenge
or alarm, because the deputation may find
occasion to send messengers abroad."</p>

<p>"A murrain on thee, thou lazy losel!" said
Rudolph&mdash;"Thou art the only sluggard of thy
kin."</p>

<p>"Then am I the only wise man of them all,"
said the youth.&mdash;"Hark ye, brave Hauptman, ye
have supped this evening,&mdash;have ye not?"</p>

<p>"It is a point of wisdom, ye owl," answered
the Bernese, "not to go into the forest fasting."</p>

<p>"If it is wisdom to eat when we are hungry,"
answered Sigismund, "there can be no folly in
sleeping when we are weary." So saying, and
after a desperate yawn or two, the relieved sentinel
halted off, giving full effect to the sprain of
which he complained.</p>

<p>"Yet there is strength in those loitering limbs,
and valour in that indolent and sluggish spirit,"
said Rudolph to the Englishman. "But it is time
that I, who censure others, should betake me to
my own task.&mdash;Hither, comrades of the watch,
hither."</p>

<p>The Bernese accompanied these words with a
whistle, which brought from within six young
men, whom he had previously chosen for the
duty, and who, after a hurried supper, now waited
his summons. One or two of them had large
bloodhounds or lyme-dogs, which, though usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
employed in the pursuit of animals of chase, were
also excellent for discovering ambuscades, in which
duty their services were now to be employed. One
of these animals was held in a leash, by the person
who, forming the advance of the party, went
about twenty yards in front of them; a second was
the property of Donnerhugel himself, who had the
creature singularly under command. Three of his
companions attended him closely, and the two
others followed, one of whom bore a horn of the
Bernese wild bull, by way of bugle. This little
party crossed the moat by the temporary bridge,
and moved on to the verge of the forest, which lay
adjacent to the castle, and the skirts of which
were most likely to conceal any ambuscade that
could be apprehended. The moon was now up, and
near the full, so that Arthur, from the elevation
on which the castle stood, could trace their slow,
cautious march, amid the broad silver light, until
they were lost in the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>When this object had ceased to occupy his eyes,
the thoughts of his lonely watch again returned
to Anne of Geierstein, and to the singular expression
of distress and apprehension which had that
evening clouded her beautiful features. Then the
blush which had chased, for the moment, paleness
and terror from her countenance, at the instant
his eyes encountered hers&mdash;was it anger&mdash;was it
modesty&mdash;was it some softer feeling, more gentle
than the one, more tender than the other? Young
Philipson, who, like Chaucer's Squire, was "as
modest as a maid," almost trembled to give to
that look the favourable interpretation which a
more self-satisfied gallant would have applied to it
without scruple. No hue of rising or setting day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
was ever so lovely in the eyes of the young man as
that blush was in his recollection; nor did ever
enthusiastic visionary or poetical dreamer find out
so many fanciful forms in the clouds, as Arthur
divined various interpretations from the indications
of interest which had passed over the beautiful
countenance of the Swiss maiden.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the thought suddenly burst on
his reverie, that it could little concern him what
was the cause of the perturbation she had exhibited.
They had met at no distant period for
the first time&mdash;they must soon part for ever. She
could be nothing more to him than the remembrance
of a beautiful vision, and he could have no
other part in her memory save as a stranger from a
foreign land, who had been a sojourner for a season
in her uncle's house, but whom she could never
expect to see again. When this idea intruded on
the train of romantic visions which agitated him,
it was like the sharp stroke of the harpoon, which
awakens the whale from slumbering torpidity into
violent action. The gateway in which the young
soldier kept his watch seemed suddenly too narrow
for him. He rushed across the temporary bridge,
and hastily traversed a short space of ground in
front of the <i>tête de pont</i>, or defensive work, on
which its outer extremity rested.</p>

<p>Here for a time he paced the narrow extent to
which he was confined by his duty as a sentinel,
with long and rapid strides, as if he had been
engaged by vow to take the greatest possible quantity
of exercise upon that limited space of ground.
His exertion, however, produced the effect of in
some degree composing his mind, recalling him
to himself, and reminding him of the numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
reasons which prohibited his fixing his attention,
much more his affections, upon this young person,
however fascinating she was.</p>

<p>I have surely, he thought, as he slackened his
pace, and shouldered his heavy partisan, sense
enough left to recollect my condition and my
duties&mdash;to think of my father, to whom I am all
in all&mdash;and to think also on the dishonour which
must accrue to me, were I capable of winning the
affections of a frank-hearted and confiding girl, to
whom I could never do justice by dedicating my
life to return them. "No," he said to himself,
"she will soon forget me, and I will study to remember
her no otherwise than I would a pleasing
dream, which hath for a moment crossed a night
of perils and dangers, such as my life seems doomed
to be."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stopped short in his walk, and
as he rested on his weapon a tear rose unbidden to
his eye, and stole down his cheek without being
wiped away. But he combated this gentler mood
of passion as he had formerly battled with that
which was of a wilder and more desperate character.
Shaking off the dejection and sinking
of spirit which he felt creeping upon him, he
resumed, at the same time, the air and attitude of
an attentive sentinel, and recalled his mind to the
duties of his watch, which, in the tumult of his
feelings, he had almost forgotten. But what was
his astonishment, when, as he looked out on the
clear landscape, there passed from the bridge
towards the forest, crossing him in the broad
moonlight, the living and moving likeness of
Anne of Geierstein!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>We know not when we sleep nor when we wake.</p>
<p>Visions distinct and perfect cross our eye,</p>
<p>Which to the slumberer seem realities;</p>
<p>And while they waked, some men have seen such sights</p>
<p>As set at naught the evidence of sense,</p>
<p>And left them well persuaded they were dreaming.</p>

<p class="i16"><span class="smcap">Anonymous.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>The apparition of Anne of Geierstein crossed her
lover&mdash;her admirer, at least we must call him&mdash;within
shorter time than we can tell the story.
But it was distinct, perfect, and undoubted. In
the very instant when the young Englishman,
shaking off his fond despondency, raised his head
to look out upon the scene of his watch, she came
from the nearer end of the bridge, crossing the
path of the sentinel, upon whom she did not even
cast a look, and passed with a rapid yet steady
pace towards the verge of the woodland.</p>

<p>It would have been natural, though Arthur had
been directed not to challenge persons who left the
castle, but only such as might approach it, that
he should nevertheless, had it only been in mere
civility, have held some communication, however
slight, with the maiden as she crossed his post.
But the suddenness of her appearance took from
him for the instant both speech and motion. It
seemed as if his own imagination had raised up
a phantom, presenting to his outward senses the
form and features which engrossed his mind; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
he was silent, partly at least from the idea that
what he gazed upon was immaterial and not of
this world.</p>

<p>It would have been no less natural that Anne of
Geierstein should have in some manner acknowledged
the person who had spent a considerable
time under the same roof with her, had been often
her partner in the dance, and her companion in
the field; but she did not evince the slightest
token of recognition, nor even look towards him as
she passed; her eye was on the wood, to which
she advanced swiftly and steadily, and she was
hidden by its boughs ere Arthur had recollected
himself sufficiently to determine what to do.</p>

<p>His first feeling was anger at himself for suffering
her to pass unquestioned, when it might well
chance that upon any errand which called her
forth at so extraordinary a time and place he
might have been enabled to afford her assistance,
or at least advice. This sentiment was for a short
time so predominant, that he ran towards the place
where he had seen the skirt of her dress disappear,
and, whispering her name as loud as the fear of
alarming the castle permitted, conjured her to return,
and hear him but for a few brief moments.
No answer, however, was returned; and when the
branches of the trees began to darken over his head
and to intercept the moonlight, he recollected that
he was leaving his post, and exposing his fellow-travellers,
who were trusting in his vigilance, to
the danger of surprise.</p>

<p>He hastened, therefore, back to the castle gate,
with matter for deeper and more inextricable doubt
and anxiety than had occupied him during the
commencement of his watch. He asked himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
in vain with what purpose that modest young
maiden, whose manners were frank, but whose conduct
had always seemed so delicate and reserved,
could sally forth at midnight like a damsel-errant
in romance, when she was in a strange country
and suspicious neighbourhood; yet he rejected, as
he would have shrunk from blasphemy, any interpretation
which could have thrown censure upon
Anne of Geierstein. No, nothing was she capable
of doing for which a friend could have to blush.
But connecting her previous agitation with the
extraordinary fact of her leaving the castle, alone
and defenceless, at such an hour, Arthur necessarily
concluded it must argue some cogent reason,
and, as was most likely, of an unpleasant nature.&mdash;"I
will watch her return," he internally uttered,
"and, if she will give me an opportunity, I will
convey to her the assurance that there is one faithful
bosom in her neighbourhood, which is bound
in honour and gratitude to pour out every drop of
its blood, if by doing so it can protect her from
the slightest inconvenience. This is no silly flight
of romance, for which common-sense has a right to
reproach me; it is only what I ought to do, what
I must do, or forego every claim to be termed a
man of honesty or honour."</p>

<p>Yet scarce did the young man think himself
anchored on a resolution which seemed unobjectionable,
than his thoughts were again adrift. He
reflected that Anne might have a desire to visit
the neighbouring town of Bâle, to which she had
been invited the day before, and where her uncle
had friends. It was indeed an uncommon hour to
select for such a purpose; but Arthur was aware
that the Swiss maidens feared neither solitary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
walks nor late hours, and that Anne would have
walked among her own hills by moonlight much
farther than the distance betwixt their place of encampment
and Bâle, to see a sick friend, or for
any similar purpose. To press himself on her
confidence, then, might be impertinence, not kindness;
and as she had passed him without taking
the slightest notice of his presence, it was evident
she did not mean voluntarily to make him her
confidant; and probably she was involved in no
difficulties where his aid could be useful. In that
case, the duty of a gentleman was to permit her to
return as she had gone forth, unnoticed and unquestioned,
leaving it with herself to hold communication
with him or not as she should choose.</p>

<p>Another idea, belonging to the age, also passed
through his mind, though it made no strong impression
upon it. This form, so perfectly resembling
Anne of Geierstein, might be a deception of
the sight, or it might be one of those fantastic
apparitions, concerning which there were so many
tales told in all countries, and of which Switzerland
and Germany had, as Arthur well knew, their
full share. The internal and undefinable feelings
which restrained him from accosting the maiden,
as might have been natural for him to have done,
are easily explained, on the supposition that his
mortal frame shrank from an encounter with a
being of a different nature. There had also been
some expressions of the magistrate of Bâle, which
might apply to the castle's being liable to be
haunted by beings from another world. But though
the general belief in such ghostly apparitions
prevented the Englishman from being positively
incredulous on the subject, yet the instructions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
his father, a man of great intrepidity and distinguished
good sense, had taught him to be extremely
unwilling to refer anything to supernatural interferences
which was capable of explanation by
ordinary rules; and he therefore shook off, without
difficulty, any feelings of superstitious fear which
for an instant connected itself with his nocturnal
adventure. He resolved finally to suppress all
disquieting conjecture on the subject, and to await
firmly, if not patiently, the return of the fair
vision, which, if it should not fully explain the
mystery, seemed at least to afford the only chance
of throwing light upon it.</p>

<p>Fixed, therefore, in purpose, he traversed the
walk which his duty permitted, with his eyes
fixed on the part of the forest where he had seen
the beloved form disappear, and forgetful for the
moment that his watch had any other purpose than
to observe her return. But from this abstraction
of mind he was roused by a distant sound
in the forest, which seemed the clash of armour.
Recalled at once to a sense of his duty, and its
importance to his father and his fellow-travellers,
Arthur planted himself on the temporary bridge,
where a stand could best be made, and turned both
eyes and ears to watch for approaching danger.
The sound of arms and footsteps came nearer&mdash;spears
and helmets advanced from the greenwood
glade, and twinkled in the moonlight. But the
stately form of Rudolph Donnerhugel, marching
in front, was easily recognised, and announced to
our sentinel the return of the patrol. Upon their
approach to the bridge, the challenge, and interchange
of sign and countersign, which is usual on
such occasions, took place in due form; and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Rudolph's party filed off one after another into the
castle, he commanded them to wake their companions,
with whom he intended to renew the
patrol, and at the same time to send a relief to
Arthur Philipson, whose watch on the bridge was
now ended. This last fact was confirmed by the
deep and distant toll of the Minster clock from
the town of Bâle, which, prolonging its sullen
sound over field and forest, announced that midnight
was past.</p>

<p>"And now, comrade," continued Rudolph to the
Englishman, "have the cold air and long watch
determined thee to retire to food and rest, or dost
thou still hold the intention of partaking our
rounds?"</p>

<p>In very truth it would have been Arthur's
choice to have remained in the place where he
was, for the purpose of watching Anne of Geierstein's
return from her mysterious excursion. He
could not easily have found an excuse for this,
however, and he was unwilling to give the haughty
Donnerhugel the least suspicion that he was inferior
in hardihood, or in the power of enduring
fatigue, to any of the tall mountaineers, whose
companion he chanced to be for the present. He
did not, therefore, indulge even a moment's hesitation;
but while he restored the borrowed partisan
to the sluggish Sigismund, who came from the
castle yawning and stretching himself like one
whose slumbers had been broken by no welcome
summons, when they were deepest and sweetest,
he acquainted Rudolph that he retained his purpose
of partaking in his reconnoitring duty. They
were speedily joined by the rest of the patrolling
party, amongst whom was Rudiger, the eldest son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of the Landamman of Unterwalden; and when, led
by the Bernese champion, they had reached the
skirts of the forest, Rudolph commanded three of
them to attend Rudiger Biederman.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt make thy round to the left side,"
said the Bernese; "I will draw off to the right&mdash;see
thou keepest a good look-out, and we will meet
merrily at the place appointed. Take one of the
hounds with you. I will keep Wolf-fanger, who
will open on a Burgundian as readily as on a bear."</p>

<p>Rudiger moved off with his party to the left,
according to the directions received; and Rudolph,
having sent forward one of his number in front,
and stationed another in the rear, commanded the
third to follow himself and Arthur Philipson, who
thus constituted the main body of the patrol.
Having intimated to their immediate attendant to
keep at such distance as to allow them freedom of
conversation, Rudolph addressed the Englishman
with the familiarity which their recent friendship
had created.&mdash;"And now, King Arthur, what
thinks the Majesty of England of our Helvetian
youth? Could they win guerdon in tilt or tourney,
thinkest thou, noble prince? Or would they rank
but amongst the coward knights of Cornouailles?"<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"For tilt and tourney I cannot answer," said
Arthur, summoning up his spirits to reply, "because
I never beheld one of you mounted on a
steed, or having spear in rest. But if strong limbs
and stout hearts are to be considered, I would
match you Swiss gallants with those of any country
in the universe, where manhood is to be looked
for, whether it be in heart or hand."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou speakest us fair; and, young Englishman,"
said Rudolph, "know that we think as
highly of thee, of which I will presently afford
thee a proof. Thou talkedst but now of horses. I
know but little of them; yet I judge thou wouldst
not buy a steed which thou hadst only seen covered
with trappings, or encumbered with saddle and
bridle, but wouldst desire to look at him when
stripped, and in his natural state of freedom?"</p>

<p>"Ay, marry, would I," said Arthur. "Thou
hast spoken on that as if thou hadst been born in
a district called Yorkshire, which men call the
merriest part of Merry England."</p>

<p>"Then I tell thee," said Rudolph Donnerhugel,
"that thou hast seen our Swiss youth but half,
since thou hast observed them as yet only in their
submissive attendance upon the elders of their
Cantons, or, at most, in their mountain-sports,
which, though they may show men's outward
strength and activity, can throw no light on the
spirit and disposition by which that strength and
activity are to be guided and directed in matters
of high enterprise."</p>

<p>The Swiss probably designed that these remarks
should excite the curiosity of the stranger. But
the Englishman had the image, look, and form of
Anne of Geierstein, as she had passed him in the
silent hours of his watch, too constantly before
him, to enter willingly upon a subject of conversation
totally foreign to what agitated his mind.
He, therefore, only compelled himself to reply in
civility, that he had no doubt his esteem for the
Swiss, both aged and young, would increase in
proportion with his more intimate knowledge of
the nation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>He was then silent; and Donnerhugel, disappointed,
perhaps, at having failed to excite his
curiosity, walked also in silence by his side.
Arthur, meanwhile, was considering with himself
whether he should mention to his companion the
circumstance which occupied his own mind, in
the hope that the kinsman of Anne of Geierstein,
and ancient friend of her house, might be able to
throw some light on the subject.</p>

<p>But he felt within his mind an insurmountable
objection to converse with the Swiss on a subject
in which Anne was concerned. That Rudolph
made pretensions to her favour could hardly be
doubted; and though Arthur, had the question
been put to him, must in common consistency
have resigned all competition on the subject, still
he could not bear to think on the possibility of
his rival's success, and would not willingly have
endured to hear him pronounce her name.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was owing to this secret irritability
that Arthur, though he made every effort to conceal
and to overcome the sensation, still felt
a secret dislike to Rudolph Donnerhugel, whose
frank but somewhat coarse familiarity was mingled
with a certain air of protection and patronage,
which the Englishman thought was by no means
called for. He met the openness of the Bernese,
indeed, with equal frankness, but he was ever and
anon tempted to reject or repel the tone of superiority
by which it was accompanied. The circumstances
of their duel had given the Swiss no
ground for such triumph; nor did Arthur feel himself
included in that roll of the Swiss youth over
whom Rudolph exercised domination by general
consent. So little did Philipson relish this affectation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
of superiority, that the poor jest, that termed
him King Arthur, although quite indifferent to
him when applied by any of the Biedermans, was
rather offensive when Rudolph took the same
liberty; so that he often found himself in the awkward
condition of one who is internally irritated,
without having any outward manner of testifying
it with propriety. Undoubtedly, the root of all this
tacit dislike to the young Bernese was a feeling
of rivalry; but it was a feeling which Arthur
dared not avow even to himself. It was sufficiently
powerful, however, to suppress the slight
inclination he had felt to speak with Rudolph on
the passage of the night which had most interested
him; and as the topic of conversation introduced
by his companion had been suffered to drop, they
walked on side by side in silence, "with the beard
on the shoulder," as the Spaniard says&mdash;looking
round, that is, on all hands; and thus performing
the duty of a vigilant watch.</p>

<p>At length, after they had walked nearly a mile
through forest and field, making a circuit around
the ruins of Graffs-lust, of such an extent as to
leave no room for an ambush betwixt them and
the place, the old hound, led by the vidette who
was foremost, stopped, and uttered a low growl.</p>

<p>"How now, Wolf-fanger!" said Rudolph, advancing.&mdash;"What,
old fellow! dost thou not
know friends from foes? Come, what sayest thou,
on better thoughts?&mdash;Thou must not lose character
in thy old age&mdash;try it again."</p>

<p>The dog raised his head, snuffed the air all
around, as if he understood what his master had
said, then shook his head and tail, as if answering
to his voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, there it is now," said Donnerhugel, patting
the animal's shaggy back; "second thoughts
are worth gold; thou seest it is a friend after all."</p>

<p>The dog again shook his tail, and moved forward
with the same unconcern as before; Rudolph
fell back into his place, and his companion said
to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are about to meet Rudiger and our companions,
I suppose, and the dog hears their footsteps,
though we cannot."</p>

<p>"It can scarcely yet be Rudiger," said the Bernese;
"his walk around the castle is of a wider
circumference than ours. Some one approaches,
however, for Wolf-fanger is again dissatisfied&mdash;Look
sharply out on all sides."</p>

<p>As Rudolph gave his party the word to be on
the alert, they reached an open glade, in which
were scattered, at considerable distance from each
other, some old pine-trees of gigantic size, which
seemed yet huger and blacker than ordinary, from
their broad sable tops and shattered branches being
displayed against the clear and white moonlight.
"We shall here, at least," said the Swiss, "have
the advantage of seeing clearly whatever approaches.
But I judge," said he, after looking around for a
minute, "it is but some wolf or deer that has
crossed our path, and the scent disturbs the hound&mdash;Hold&mdash;stop&mdash;yes,
it must be so; he goes on."</p>

<p>The dog accordingly proceeded, after having
given some signs of doubt, uncertainty, and even
anxiety. Apparently, however, he became reconciled
to what had disturbed him, and proceeded
once more in the ordinary manner.</p>

<p>"This is singular!" said Arthur Philipson;
"and, to my thinking, I saw an object close by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
yonder patch of thicket, where, as well as I can
guess, a few thorn and hazel bushes surround the
stems of four or five large trees."</p>

<p>"My eye has been on that very thicket for
these five minutes past, and I saw nothing," said
Rudolph.</p>

<p>"Nay, but," answered the young Englishman,
"I saw the object, whatever it was, while you
were engaged in attending to the dog. And by
your permission, I will forward and examine the
spot."</p>

<p>"Were you, strictly speaking, under my command,"
said Donnerhugel, "I would command you
to keep your place. If they be foes, it is essential
that we should remain together. But you are a
volunteer in our watch, and therefore may use your
freedom."</p>

<p>"I thank you," answered Arthur, and sprang
quickly forward.</p>

<p>He felt, indeed, at the moment, that he was not
acting courteously as an individual, nor perhaps
correctly as a soldier; and that he ought to have
rendered obedience, for the time, to the captain of
the party in which he had enlisted himself. But,
on the other hand, the object which he had seen,
though at a distance and imperfectly, seemed to
bear a resemblance to the retiring form of Anne of
Geierstein, as she had vanished from his eyes, an
hour or two before, under the cover of the forest;
and his ungovernable curiosity to ascertain whether
it might not be the maiden in person, allowed him
to listen to no other consideration.</p>

<p>Ere Rudolph had spoken out his few words of
reply, Arthur was halfway to the thicket. It was,
as it had seemed at a distance, of small extent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
and not fitted to hide any person who did not
actually couch down amongst the dwarf bushes
and underwood. Anything white, also, which bore
the human size and form must, he thought, have
been discovered among the dark-red stems and
swarthy-coloured bushes which were before him.
These observations were mingled with other
thoughts. If it was Anne of Geierstein whom
he had a second time seen, she must have left the
more open path, desirous probably of avoiding
notice; and what right or title had he to direct
upon her the observation of the patrol? He had,
he thought, observed that, in general, the maiden
rather repelled than encouraged the attentions of
Rudolph Donnerhugel; or, where it would have
been discourteous to have rejected them entirely,
that she endured without encouraging them.
What, then, could be the propriety of his intruding
upon her private walk, singular, indeed, from
time and place, but which, on that account, she
might be more desirous to keep secret from the
observation of one who was disagreeable to her?
Nay, was it not possible that Rudolph might
derive advantage to his otherwise unacceptable
suit, by possessing the knowledge of something
which the maiden desired to be concealed?</p>

<p>As these thoughts pressed upon him, Arthur
made a pause, with his eyes fixed on the thicket,
from which he was now scarce thirty yards distant;
and although scrutinising it with all the
keen accuracy which his uncertainty and anxiety
dictated, he was actuated by a strong feeling that
it would be wisest to turn back to his companions,
and report to Rudolph that his eyes had deceived
him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>But while he was yet undecided whether to
advance or return, the object which he had seen
became again visible on the verge of the thicket,
and advanced straight towards him, bearing, as on
the former occasion, the exact dress and figure of
Anne of Geierstein! This vision&mdash;for the time,
place, and suddenness of the appearance made it
seem rather an illusion than a reality&mdash;struck
Arthur with surprise, which amounted to terror.
The figure passed within a spear's-length, unchallenged
by him, and giving not the slightest sign
of recognition; and, directing its course to the
right hand of Rudolph, and the two or three who
were with him, was again lost among the broken
ground and bushes.</p>

<p>Once more the young man was reduced to a state
of the most inextricable doubt; nor was he roused
from the stupor into which he was thrown, till
the voice of the Bernese sounded in his ear&mdash;"Why,
how now, King Arthur&mdash;art thou asleep,
or art thou wounded?"</p>

<p>"Neither," said Philipson, collecting himself;
"only much surprised."</p>

<p>"Surprised? and at what, most royal"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forbear foolery," said Arthur, somewhat
sternly, "and answer as thou art a man&mdash;Did she
not meet thee?&mdash;didst thou not see her?"</p>

<p>"See her!&mdash;see whom?" said Donnerhugel.
"I saw no one. And I could have sworn you had
seen no one either, for I had you in my eye the
whole time of your absence, excepting two or three
moments. If you saw aught, why gave you not
the alarm?"</p>

<p>"Because it was only a woman," answered
Arthur, faintly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"Only a woman!" repeated Rudolph, in a tone
of contempt. "By my honest word, King Arthur,
if I had not seen pretty flashes of valour fly from
thee at times, I should be apt to think that thou
hadst only a woman's courage thyself. Strange,
that a shadow by night, or a precipice in the day,
should quell so bold a spirit as thou hast often
shown"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And as I will ever show, when occasion demands
it," interrupted the Englishman, with recovered
spirit. "But I swear to you, that if I be now
daunted, it is by no mere earthly fears that my
mind hath been for a moment subdued."</p>

<p>"Let us proceed on our walk," said Rudolph;
"we must not neglect the safety of our friends.
This appearance, of which thou speakest, may be
but a trick to interrupt our duty."</p>

<p>They moved on through the moonlight glades.
A minute's reflection restored young Philipson to
his full recollection, and with that to the painful
consciousness that he had played a ridiculous and
unworthy part in the presence of the person whom
(of the male sex, at least) he would the very last
have chosen as a witness of his weakness.</p>

<p>He ran hastily over the relations which stood
betwixt himself, Donnerhugel, the Landamman,
his niece, and the rest of that family; and, contrary
to the opinion which he had entertained but
a short while before, settled in his own mind that
it was his duty to mention to the immediate leader
under whom he had placed himself, the appearance
which he had twice observed in the course of
that night's duty. There might be family circumstances&mdash;the
payment of a vow, perhaps, or some
such reason&mdash;which might render intelligible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
her connections the behaviour of this young lady.
Besides, he was for the present a soldier on duty,
and these mysteries might be fraught with evils
to be anticipated or guarded against; in either
case, his companions were entitled to be made
aware of what he had seen. It must be supposed
that this resolution was adopted when the sense
of duty, and of shame for the weakness which
he had exhibited, had for the moment subdued
Arthur's personal feelings towards Anne of Geierstein&mdash;feelings,
also, liable to be chilled by the
mysterious uncertainty which the events of that
evening had cast, like a thick mist, around the
object of them.</p>

<p>While the Englishman's reflections were taking
this turn, his captain or companion, after a silence
of several minutes, at length addressed him.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "my dear comrade, that,
as being at present your officer, I have some title
to hear from you the report of what you have just
now seen, since it must be something of importance
which could so strongly agitate a mind so
firm as yours. But if, in your own opinion, it
consists with the general safety to delay your
report of what you have seen until we return to
the castle, and then to deliver it to the private ear
of the Landamman, you have only to intimate
your purpose; and, far from urging you to place
confidence in me personally, though I hope I am not
undeserving of it, I will authorise your leaving
us, and returning instantly to the castle."</p>

<p>This proposal touched him to whom it was made
exactly in the right place. An absolute demand
of his confidence might perhaps have been declined;
the tone of moderate request and conciliation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
fell presently in with the Englishman's own
reflections.</p>

<p>"I am sensible," he said, "Hauptman, that I
ought to mention to you that which I have seen
to-night; but on the first occasion, it did not fall
within my duty to do so; and, now that I have
a second time witnessed the same appearance, I
have felt for these few seconds so much surprised
at what I have seen, that even yet I can scarce
find words to express it."</p>

<p>"As I cannot guess what you may have to
say," replied the Bernese, "I must beseech you to
be explicit. We are but poor readers of riddles, we
thick-headed Switzers."</p>

<p>"Yet it is but a riddle which I have to place
before you, Rudolph Donnerhugel," answered the
Englishman, "and a riddle which is far beyond
my own guessing at." He then proceeded, though
not without hesitation, "While you were performing
your first patrol amongst the ruins, a female
crossed the bridge from within the castle, walked
by my post without saying a single word, and
vanished under the shadows of the forest."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Donnerhugel, and made no
further answer.</p>

<p>Arthur proceeded. "Within these five minutes,
the same female form passed me a second time, issuing
from the little thicket and clump of firs, and
disappeared, without exchanging a word. Know,
further, this apparition bore the form, face, gait,
and dress of your kinswoman, Anne of Geierstein."</p>

<p>"Singular enough," said Rudolph, in a tone of
incredulity. "I must not, I suppose, dispute your
word, for you would receive doubt on my part as
a mortal injury&mdash;such is your northern chivalry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Yet, let me say, I have eyes as well as you, and
I scarce think they quitted you for a minute.
We were not fifty yards from the place where I
found you standing in amazement. How, therefore,
should not we also have seen that which you
say and think you saw?"</p>

<p>"To that I can give no answer," said Arthur.
"Perhaps your eyes were not exactly turned upon
me during the short space in which I saw this
form&mdash;perhaps it might be visible&mdash;as they say
fantastic appearances sometimes are&mdash;to only one
person at a time."</p>

<p>"You suppose, then, that the appearance was
imaginary, or fantastic?" said the Bernese.</p>

<p>"Can I tell you?" replied the Englishman.
"The Church gives its warrant that there are such
things; and surely it is more natural to believe
this apparition to be an illusion, than to suppose
that Anne of Geierstein, a gentle and well-nurtured
maiden, should be traversing the woods
at this wild hour, when safety and propriety so
strongly recommend her being within doors."</p>

<p>"There is much in what you say," said Rudolph;
"and yet there are stories afloat, though few care
to mention them, which seem to allege that Anne
of Geierstein is not altogether such as other
maidens; and that she has been met with, in body
and spirit, where she could hardly have come by
her own unassisted efforts."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Arthur; "so young, so beautiful,
and already in league with the destroyer of mankind!
It is impossible."</p>

<p>"I said not so," replied the Bernese; "nor have
I leisure at present to explain my meaning more
fully. As we return to the castle of Graffs-lust, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
may have an opportunity to tell you more. But
I chiefly brought you on this patrol to introduce
you to some friends, whom you will be pleased to
know, and who desire your acquaintance; and it
is here I expect to meet them."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned round the projecting corner
of a rock, and an unexpected scene was presented
to the eyes of the young Englishman.</p>

<p>In a sort of nook, or corner, screened by the
rocky projection, there burned a large fire of wood,
and around it sat, reclined, or lay, twelve or
fifteen young men in the Swiss garb, but decorated
with ornaments and embroidery, which reflected
back the light of the fire. The same red gleam
was returned by silver wine-cups, which circulated
from hand to hand with the flasks which filled
them. Arthur could also observe the relics of a
banquet, to which due honour seemed to have been
lately rendered.</p>

<p>The revellers started joyfully up at the sight
of Donnerhugel and his companions, and saluted
him, easily distinguished as he was by his stature,
by the title of Captain, warmly and exultingly
uttered, while, at the same time, every tendency
to noisy acclamation was cautiously suppressed.
The zeal indicated that Rudolph came most welcome&mdash;the
caution that he came in secret, and
was to be received with mystery.</p>

<p>To the general greeting he answered,&mdash;"I thank
you, my brave comrades. Has Rudiger yet reached
you?"</p>

<p>"Thou seest he has not," said one of the party;
"had it been so, we would have detained him here
till your coming, brave Captain."</p>

<p>"He has loitered on his patrol," said the Bernese.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
"We too were delayed, yet we are here
before him. I bring with me, comrades, the brave
Englishman, whom I mentioned to you as a desirable
associate in our daring purpose."</p>

<p>"He is welcome, most welcome to us," said a
young man, whose richly embroidered dress of
azure blue gave him an air of authority; "most
welcome is he, if he brings with him a heart and
a hand to serve our noble task."</p>

<p>"For both I will be responsible," said Rudolph.
"Pass the wine-cup, then, to the success of our
glorious enterprise, and the health of this our
new associate!"</p>

<p>While they were replenishing the cups with
wine of a quality far superior to any which
Arthur had yet tasted in these regions, he thought
it right, before engaging himself in the pledge,
to learn the secret object of the association which
seemed desirous of adopting him.</p>

<p>"Before I engage my poor services to you, fair
sirs, since it pleases you to desire them, permit
me," he said, "to ask the purpose and character
of the undertaking in which they are to be
employed."</p>

<p>"Shouldst thou have brought him hither," said
the cavalier in blue to Rudolph, "without satisfying
him and thyself on that point?"</p>

<p>"Care not thou about it, Lawrenz," replied the
Bernese, "I know my man.&mdash;Be it known, then,
to you, my good friend," he continued, addressing
the Englishman, "that my comrades and I are
determined at once to declare the freedom of the
Swiss commerce, and to resist to the death, if it
be necessary, all unlawful and extortionate demands
on the part of our neighbours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>"I understand so much," said the young Englishman,
"and that the present deputation proceeds
to the Duke of Burgundy with remonstrances
to that effect."</p>

<p>"Hear me," replied Rudolph. "The question
is like to be brought to a bloody determination
long ere we see the Duke of Burgundy's most
august and most gracious countenance. That his
influence should be used to exclude us from Bâle,
a neutral town, and pertaining to the empire,
gives us cause to expect the worst reception when
we enter his own dominions. We have even reason
to think that we might have suffered from his
hatred already, but for the vigilance of the ward
which we have kept. Horsemen, from the direction
of La Ferette, have this night reconnoitred
our posts; and had they not found us prepared,
we had, without question, been attacked in our
quarters. But since we have escaped to-night, we
must take care for to-morrow. For this purpose,
a number of the bravest youth of the city of
Bâle, incensed at the pusillanimity of their magistrates,
are determined to join us, in order to wipe
away the disgrace which the cowardly inhospitality
of their magistracy has brought on their native
place."</p>

<p>"That we will do ere the sun, that will rise two
hours hence, shall sink into the western sky,"
said the cavalier in blue; and those around joined
him in stern assent.</p>

<p>"Gentle sirs," replied Arthur, when there was
a pause, "let me remind you, that the embassy
which you attend is a peaceful one, and that those
who act as its escort ought to avoid anything
which can augment the differences which it comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to reconcile. You cannot expect to receive offence
in the Duke's dominions, the privileges of envoys
being respected in all civilised countries; and you
will, I am sure, desire to offer none."</p>

<p>"We may be subjected to insult, however,"
replied the Bernese, "and that through your concerns,
Arthur Philipson, and those of thy father."</p>

<p>"I understand you not," replied Philipson.</p>

<p>"Your father," answered Donnerhugel, "is a
merchant, and bears with him wares of small bulk
but high value?"</p>

<p>"He does so," answered Arthur; "and what of
that?"</p>

<p>"Marry," answered Rudolph, "that if it be not
better looked to, the Bandog of Burgundy is like
to fall heir to a large proportion of your silks,
satins, and jewellery work."</p>

<p>"Silks, satins, and jewels!" exclaimed another
of the revellers; "such wares will not pass toll-free
where Archibald of Hagenbach hath authority."</p>

<p>"Fair sirs," resumed Arthur, after a moment's
consideration, "these wares are my father's property,
not mine; and it is for him, not me, to pronounce
how much of them he might be content to
part with in the way of toll, rather than give
occasion to a fray in which his companions, who
have received him into their society, must be
exposed to injury as well as himself. I can only
say, that he has weighty affairs at the court of
Burgundy, which must render him desirous of
reaching it in peace with all men; and it is my
private belief that, rather than incur the loss and
danger of a broil with the garrison of La Ferette,
he would be contented to sacrifice all the property
which he has at present with him. Therefore, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
must request of you, gentlemen, a space to consult
his pleasure on this occasion; assuring you, that if
it be his will to resist the payment of these duties
to Burgundy, you shall find in me one who is fully
determined to fight to the last drop of his blood."</p>

<p>"Good King Arthur," said Rudolph; "thou art
a dutiful observer of the Fifth Commandment,
and thy days shall be long in the land. Do not
suppose us neglectful of the same duty, although,
for the present, we conceive ourselves bound, in
the first place, to attend to the weal of our country,
the common parent of our fathers and ourselves.
But as you know our profound respect for
the Landamman, you need not fear that we shall
willingly offer him offence, by rashly engaging in
hostilities, or without some weighty reason; and
an attempt to plunder his guest would have been
met, on his part, with resistance to the death. I
had hoped to find both you and your father prompt
enough to resent such a gross injury. Nevertheless,
if your father inclines to present his fleece to
be shorn by Archibald of Hagenbach, whose scissors,
he will find, clip pretty closely, it would
be unnecessary and uncivil in us to interpose.
Meantime, you have the advantage of knowing,
that in case the Governor of La Ferette should be
disposed to strip you of skin as well as fleece,
there are more men close at hand than you looked
for, whom you will find both able and willing to
render you prompt assistance."</p>

<p>"On these terms," said the Englishman, "I
make my acknowledgments to these gentlemen of
Bâle, or whatever other country hath sent them
forth, and pledge them in a brotherly cup to our
further and more intimate acquaintance."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>"Health and prosperity to the United Cantons,
and their friends!" answered the Blue Cavalier.
"And death and confusion to all besides."</p>

<p>The cups were replenished; and instead of a
shout of applause, the young men around testified
their devoted determination to the cause which was
thus announced, by grasping each other's hands,
and then brandishing their weapons with a fierce
yet noiseless gesture.</p>

<p>"Thus," said Rudolph Donnerhugel, "our illustrious
ancestors, the fathers of Swiss independence,
met in the immortal field of Rutli, between Uri
and Unterwalden. Thus they swore to each other,
under the blue firmament of heaven, that they
would restore the liberty of their oppressed country;
and history can tell how well they kept their
word."</p>

<p>"And she shall record," said the Blue Cavalier,
"how well the present Switzers can preserve the
freedom which their fathers won.&mdash;Proceed in
your rounds, good Rudolph, and be assured that at
the signal of the Hauptman the soldiers will not
be far absent;&mdash;all is arranged as formerly, unless
you have new orders to give us."</p>

<p>"Hark thee hither, Lawrenz," said Rudolph to
the Blue Cavalier,&mdash;and Arthur could hear him
say,&mdash;"Beware, my friend, that the Rhine wine
be not abused;&mdash;if there is too much provision of
it, manage to destroy the flasks;&mdash;a mule may
stumble, thou knowest, or so. Give not way to
Rudiger in this. He is grown a wine-bibber since
he joined us. We must bring both heart and hand
to what may be done to-morrow."&mdash;They then
whispered so low, that Arthur could hear nothing
of their further conference, and bid each other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
adieu, after clasping hands, as if they were renewing
some solemn pledge of union.</p>

<p>Rudolph and his party then moved forward, and
were scarce out of sight of their new associates,
when the vidette, or foremost of their patrol, gave
the signal of alarm. Arthur's heart leaped to
his lips&mdash;"It is Anne of Geierstein!" he said
internally.</p>

<p>"The dogs are silent," said the Bernese. "Those
who approach must be the companions of our
watch."</p>

<p>They proved, accordingly, to be Rudiger and his
party, who, halting on the appearance of their
comrades, made and underwent a formal challenge;
such advance had the Swiss already made in military
discipline, which was but little and rudely
studied by the infantry in other parts of Europe.
Arthur could hear Rudolph take his friend Rudiger
to task for not meeting him at the halting-place
appointed. "It leads to new revelry on your
arrival," he said, "and to-morrow must find us
cool and determined."</p>

<p>"Cool as an icicle, noble Hauptman," answered
the son of the Landamman, "and determined as
the rock it hangs upon."</p>

<p>Rudolph again recommended temperance, and
the young Biederman promised compliance. The
two parties passed each other with friendly though
silent greeting; and there was soon a considerable
distance between them.</p>

<p>The country was more open on the side of the
castle, around which their duty now led them,
than where it lay opposite to the principal gate.
The glades were broad, the trees thinly scattered
over pasture land, and there were no thickets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
ravines, or similar places of ambush, so that the
eye might, in the clear moonlight, well command
the country.</p>

<p>"Here," said Rudolph, "we may judge ourselves
secure enough for some conference; and therefore
may I ask thee, Arthur of England, now thou hast
seen us more closely, what thinkest thou of the
Switzer youth? If thou hast learned less than I
could have wished, thank thine own uncommunicative
temper, which retired in some degree from
our confidence."</p>

<p>"Only in so far as I could not have answered,
and therefore ought not to have received it," said
Arthur. "The judgment I have been enabled to
form amounts, in few words, to this: Your purposes
are lofty and noble as your mountains; but
the stranger from the low country is not accustomed
to tread the circuitous path by which
you ascend them. My foot has been always accustomed
to move straight forward upon the
greensward."</p>

<p>"You speak in riddles," answered the Bernese.</p>

<p>"Not so," returned the Englishman. "I think
you ought plainly to mention to your seniors (the
nominal leaders of young men who seem well disposed
to take their own road) that you expect an
attack in the neighbourhood of La Ferette, and
hope for assistance from some of the townsmen of
Bâle."</p>

<p>"Ay, truly," answered Donnerhugel; "and the
Landamman would stop his journey till he despatched
a messenger for a safe-conduct to the Duke
of Burgundy; and should he grant it, there were
an end of all hope of war."</p>

<p>"True," replied Arthur; "but the Landamman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
would thereby obtain his own principal object,
and the sole purpose of the mission&mdash;that is, the
establishment of peace."</p>

<p>"Peace&mdash;peace?" answered the Bernese, hastily.
"Were my wishes alone to be opposed to those
of Arnold Biederman, I know so much of his
honour and faith, I respect so highly his valour
and patriotism, that at his voice I would sheathe
my sword, even if my most mortal enemy stood
before me. But mine is not the single wish of a
single man; the whole of my canton, and that of
Soleure, are determined on war. It was by war,
noble war, that our fathers came forth from the
house of their captivity&mdash;it was by war, successful
and glorious war, that a race, who had been
held scarce so much worth thinking on as the oxen
which they goaded, emerged at once into liberty
and consequence, and were honoured because they
were feared, as much as they had been formerly
despised because they were unresisting."</p>

<p>"This may be all very true," said the young
Englishman; "but, in my opinion, the object of
your mission has been determined by your Diet
or House of Commons. They have resolved to
send you with others as messengers of peace; but
you are secretly blowing the coals of war; and
while all, or most of your senior colleagues are
setting out to-morrow in expectation of a peaceful
journey, you stand prepared for a combat, and look
for the means of giving cause for it."</p>

<p>"And is it not well that I do stand so prepared?"
answered Rudolph. "If our reception in
Burgundy's dependencies be peaceful, as you say
the rest of the deputation expect, my precautions
will be needless; but at least they can do no harm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
If it prove otherwise, I shall be the means of
averting a great misfortune from my colleagues, my
kinsman Arnold Biederman, my fair cousin Anne,
your father, yourself&mdash;from all of us, in short,
who are joyously travelling together."</p>

<p>Arthur shook his head. "There is something
in all this," he said, "which I understand not,
and will not seek to understand. I only pray
that you will not make my father's concerns the
subject of breaking truce; it may, as you hint,
involve the Landamman in a quarrel, which he
might otherwise have avoided. I am sure my father
will never forgive it."</p>

<p>"I have pledged my word," said Rudolph,
"already to that effect. But if he should like the
usage of the Bandog of Burgundy less than you
seem to apprehend he will, there is no harm in
your knowing that, in time of need, he may be
well and actively supported."</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged by the assurance," replied
the Englishman.</p>

<p>"And thou mayst thyself, my friend," continued
Rudolph, "take a warning from what thou hast
heard: Men go not to a bridal in armour, nor to
a brawl in silken doublet."</p>

<p>"I will be clad to meet the worst," said Arthur;
"and for that purpose I will don a light hauberk
of well-tempered steel, proof against spear or arrow;
and I thank you for your kindly counsel."</p>

<p>"Nay, thank not me," said Rudolph; "I were
ill deserving to be a leader did I not make those
who are to follow me&mdash;more especially so trusty a
follower as thou art&mdash;aware of the time when they
should buckle on their armour, and prepare for
hard blows."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>Here the conversation paused for a moment or
two, neither of the speakers being entirely contented
with his companion, although neither
pressed any further remark.</p>

<p>The Bernese, judging from the feelings which
he had seen predominate among the traders of his
own country, had entertained little doubt that the
Englishman, finding himself powerfully supported
in point of force, would have caught at the opportunity
to resist paying the exorbitant imposts with
which he was threatened at the next town, which
would probably, without any effort on Rudolph's
part, have led to breaking off the truce on the part
of Arnold Biederman himself, and to an instant
declaration of hostilities. On the other hand,
young Philipson could not understand or approve of
Donnerhugel's conduct, who, himself a member of
a peaceful deputation, seemed to be animated with
the purpose of seizing an opportunity to kindle the
flames of war.</p>

<p>Occupied by these various reflections, they
walked side by side for some time without speaking
together, until Rudolph broke silence.</p>

<p>"Your curiosity is then ended, Sir Englishman,"
said he, "respecting the apparition of Anne
of Geierstein?"</p>

<p>"Far from it," replied Philipson; "but I would
unwillingly intrude any questions on you while
you are busy with the duties of your patrol."</p>

<p>"That may be considered as over," said the
Bernese, "for there is not a bush near us to cover
a Burgundian knave, and a glance around us from
time to time is all that is now needful to prevent
surprise. And so, listen while I tell a tale, never
sung or harped in hall or bower, and which, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
begin to think, deserves as much credit, at least,
as is due to the Tales of the Round Table, which
ancient troubadours and minne-singers dole out to
us as the authentic chronicles of your renowned
namesake.</p>

<p>"Of Anne's ancestors on the male side of the
house," continued Rudolph, "I dare say you have
heard enough, and are well aware how they dwelt
in the old walls at Geierstein beside the cascade,
grinding their vassals, devouring the substance of
their less powerful neighbours, and plundering the
goods of the travellers whom ill luck sent within
ken of the vulture's eyry, the one year; and in
the next, wearying the shrines for mercy for their
trespasses, overwhelming the priests with the
wealth which they showered upon them, and,
finally, vowing vows, and making pilgrimages,
sometimes as palmers, sometimes as crusaders as
far as Jerusalem itself, to atone for the iniquities
which they had committed without hesitation or
struggle of conscience."</p>

<p>"Such, I have understood," replied the young
Englishman, "was the history of the house of
Geierstein, till Arnold, or his immediate ancestors,
exchanged the lance for the sheep-hook."</p>

<p>"But it is said," replied the Bernese, "that
the powerful and wealthy Barons of Arnheim, of
Swabia, whose only female descendant became the
wife to Count Albert of Geierstein, and the mother
of this young person, whom Swiss call simply
Anne, and Germans Countess Anne of Geierstein,
were nobles of a different caste. They did not
restrict their lives within the limits of sinning
and repenting&mdash;of plundering harmless peasants,
and pampering fat monks; but were distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
for something more than building castles with
dungeons and folter-kammers, or torture-chambers,
and founding monasteries with Galilees and
Refectories.</p>

<p>"These same Barons of Arnheim were men who
strove to enlarge the boundaries of human knowledge,
and converted their castle into a species of
college, where there were more ancient volumes
than the monks have piled together in the library
of St. Gall. Nor were their studies in books
alone. Deep buried in their private laboratories,
they attained secrets which were afterwards transmitted
through the race from father to son, and
were supposed to have approached nearly to the
deepest recesses of alchemy. The report of their
wisdom and their wealth was often brought to the
Imperial footstool; and in the frequent disputes
which the Emperors maintained with the Popes of
old, it is said they were encouraged, if not instigated,
by the counsels of the Barons of Arnheim,
and supported by their treasures. It was, perhaps,
such a course of politics, joined to the
unusual and mysterious studies which the family
of Arnheim so long pursued, which excited against
them the generally received opinion, that they
were assisted in their superhuman researches by
supernatural influences. The priests were active
in forwarding this cry against men who, perhaps,
had no other fault than that of being wiser than
themselves.</p>

<p>"'Look what guests,' they said, 'are received in
the halls of Arnheim! Let a Christian knight,
crippled in war with the Saracens, present himself
on the drawbridge, he is guerdoned with a crust
and a cup of wine, and required to pass on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
way. If a palmer, redolent of the sanctity acquired
by his recent visits to the most holy
shrines, and by the sacred relics which attest and
reward his toil, approach the unhallowed walls,
the warder bends his crossbow, and the porter
shuts the gate, as if the wandering saint brought
the plague with him from Palestine. But comes
there a greybearded, glib-tongued Greek, with his
parchment scrolls, the very letters of which are
painful to Christian eyes&mdash;comes there a Jewish
Rabbin, with his Talmud and Cabala&mdash;comes
there a swarthy sun-burnt Moor, who can boast of
having read the language of the Stars in Chaldea,
the cradle of astrological science&mdash;Lo, the wandering
impostor or sorcerer occupies the highest
seat at the Baron of Arnheim's board, shares with
him the labours of the alembic and the furnace,
learns from him mystic knowledge, like that of
which our first parents participated to the overthrow
of their race, and requites it with lessons
more dreadful than he receives, till the profane
host has added to his hoard of unholy wisdom all
that the pagan visitor can communicate. And
these things are done in Almain, which is called
the Holy Roman Empire, of which so many priests
are princes!&mdash;they are done, and neither ban nor
monition is issued against a race of sorcerers,
who, from age to age, go on triumphing in their
necromancy!'</p>

<p>"Such arguments, which were echoed from
mitred Abbots to the cell of Anchorites, seem,
nevertheless, to have made little impression on
the Imperial council. But they served to excite
the zeal of many a Baron and Free Count of the
Empire, who were taught by them to esteem a war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
or feud with the Barons of Arnheim as partaking
of the nature, and entitled to the immunities, of a
crusade against the enemies of the Faith, and to
regard an attack upon these obnoxious potentates
as a mode of clearing off their deep scores with the
Christian Church. But the Lords of Arnheim,
though not seeking for quarrel, were by no means
unwarlike, or averse to maintaining their own
defence. Some, on the contrary, belonging to this
obnoxious race, were not the less distinguished
as gallant knights and good men-at-arms. They
were, besides, wealthy, secured and strengthened
by great alliances, and in an eminent degree wise
and provident. This the parties who assailed them
learned to their cost.</p>

<p>"The confederacies formed against the Lords of
Arnheim were broken up; the attacks which their
enemies meditated were anticipated and disconcerted;
and those who employed actual violence
were repelled with signal loss to the assailants:
until at length an impression was produced in
their neighbourhood, that by their accurate information
concerning meditated violence, and their
extraordinary powers of resisting and defeating
it, the obnoxious Barons must have brought to
their defence means which merely human force
was incapable of overthrowing; so that, becoming
as much feared as hated, they were suffered for the
last generation to remain unmolested. And this
was the rather the case, that the numerous vassals
of this great house were perfectly satisfied with
their feudal superiors, abundantly ready to rise
in their defence, and disposed to believe that,
whether their lords were sorcerers or no, their own
condition would not be mended by exchanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
their government, either for the rule of the crusaders
in this holy warfare, or that of the churchmen
by whom it was instigated. The race of these
barons ended in Herman von Arnheim, the maternal
grandfather of Anne of Geierstein. He was
buried with his helmet, sword, and shield, as is
the German custom with the last male of a noble
family.</p>

<p>"But he left an only daughter, Sybilla of
Arnheim, to inherit a considerable portion of his
estate; and I never heard that the strong imputation
of sorcery which attached to her house,
prevented numerous applications, from persons of
the highest distinction in the Empire, to her legal
guardian, the Emperor, for the rich heiress's
hand in marriage. Albert of Geierstein, however,
though an exile, obtained the preference. He was
gallant and handsome, which recommended him
to Sybilla; and the Emperor, bent at the time on
the vain idea of recovering his authority in the
Swiss mountains, was desirous to show himself
generous to Albert, whom he considered as a fugitive
from his country for espousing the imperial
cause. You may thus see, most noble King
Arthur, that Anne of Geierstein, the only child of
their marriage, descends from no ordinary stock;
and that circumstances in which she may be concerned
are not to be explained or judged of so
easily, or upon the same grounds of reasoning, as
in the case of ordinary persons."</p>

<p>"By my honest word, Sir Rudolph of Donnerhugel,"
said Arthur, studiously labouring to keep
a command upon his feelings, "I can see nothing
in your narrative, and understand nothing from it,
unless it be that because in Germany, as in other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
countries, there have been fools who have annexed
the idea of witchcraft and sorcery to the possession
of knowledge and wisdom, you are therefore disposed
to stigmatise a young maiden, who has
always been respected and beloved by those around
her, as a disciple of arts which, I trust, are as
uncommon as unlawful."</p>

<p>Rudolph paused ere he replied.</p>

<p>"I could have wished," he said, "that you had
been satisfied with the general character of Anne
of Geierstein's maternal family, as offering some
circumstances which may account for what you
have, according to your own report, this night
witnessed, and I am really unwilling to go into
more particular details. To no one can Anne of
Geierstein's fame be so dear as to me. I am, after
her uncle's family, her nearest relative, and had
she remained in Switzerland, or should she, as is
most probable, return thither after the present
visit to her father, perhaps our connection might
be drawn yet closer. This has, indeed, only been
prevented by certain prejudices of her uncle's
respecting her father's authority, and the nearness
of our relationship, which, however, comes within
reach of a licence very frequently obtained. But
I only mention these things, to show you how
much more tender I must necessarily hold Anne
of Geierstein's reputation, than it is possible for
you to do, being a stranger, known to her but a
short while since, and soon to part with her, as I
understand your purpose, for ever."</p>

<p>The turn taken in this kind of apology irritated
Arthur so highly, that it required all the reasons
which recommended coolness to enable him to
answer with assumed composure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>"I can have no ground, Sir Hauptman," he
said, "to challenge any opinion which you may
entertain of a young person with whom you are so
closely connected, as you appear to be with Anne
of Geierstein. I only wonder that, with such
regard for her as your relationship implies, you
should be disposed to receive, on popular and
trivial traditions, a belief which must injuriously
affect your kinswoman, more especially one with
whom you intimate a wish to form a still more
close connection. Bethink you, sir, that in all
Christian lands, the imputation of sorcery is the
most foul which can be thrown on Christian man
or woman."</p>

<p>"And I am so far from intimating such an imputation,"
said Rudolph, somewhat fiercely, "that,
by the good sword I wear, he that dared give breath
to such a thought against Anne of Geierstein must
undergo my challenge, and take my life, or lose
his own. But the question is not whether the
maiden herself practises sorcery, which he who
avers had better get ready his tomb, and provide
for his soul's safety; the doubt lies here, whether,
as the descendant of a family whose relations with
the unseen world are reported to have been of the
closest degree, elfish and fantastical beings may
not have power to imitate her form, and to present
her appearance where she is not personally present&mdash;in
fine, whether they have permission to play
at her expense fantastical tricks, which they cannot
exercise over other mortals, whose forefathers
have ever regulated their lives by the rules of the
Church, and died in regular communion with it.
And as I sincerely desire to retain your esteem, I
have no objection to communicate to you more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
particular circumstances respecting her genealogy,
confirming the idea I have now expressed. But
you will understand they are of the most private
nature, and that I expect secrecy under the strictest
personal penalty."</p>

<p>"I shall be silent, sir," replied the young Englishman,
still struggling with suppressed passion,
"on everything respecting the character of a maiden
whom I am bound to respect so highly. But the
fear of no man's displeasure can add a feather's
weight to the guarantee of my own honour."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said Rudolph; "it is not my wish
to awake angry feelings; but I am desirous, both
for the sake of your good opinion, which I value,
and also for the plainer explanation of what I have
darkly intimated, to communicate to you what
otherwise I would much rather have left untold."</p>

<p>"You must be guided by your own sense of
what is necessary and proper in the case," answered
Philipson; "but remember I press not on your
confidence for the communication of anything that
ought to remain secret, far less where that young
lady is the subject."</p>

<p>Rudolph answered, after a minute's pause,&mdash;"Thou
hast seen and heard too much, Arthur, not
to learn the whole, or at least all that I know, or
apprehend, on the mysterious subject. It is impossible
but the circumstances must at times recur
to your recollection, and I am desirous that you
should possess all the information necessary to
understand them as clearly as the nature of the
facts will permit. We have yet, keeping leftward
to view the bog, upwards of a mile to make ere
the circuit of the castle is accomplished. It will
afford leisure enough for the tale I have to tell."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak on&mdash;I listen!" answered the Englishman,
divided between his desire to know all that it
was possible to learn concerning Anne of Geierstein,
and his dislike to hear her name pronounced with
such pretensions as those of Donnerhugel, together
with the revival of his original prejudices against
the gigantic Swiss, whose manners, always blunt,
nearly to coarseness, seemed now marked by assumed
superiority and presumption. Arthur listened,
however, to his wild tale, and the interest
which he took in it soon overpowered all other
sensations.

<p>I told you (said Rudolph) that the Lords of
Arnheim, though from father to son they were
notoriously addicted to secret studies, were, nevertheless,
like the other German nobles, followers of
war and the chase. This was peculiarly the case
with Anne's maternal grandfather, Herman of
Arnheim, who prided himself on possessing a
splendid stud of horses, and one steed in particular,
the noblest ever known in these circles of
Germany. I should make wild work were I to
attempt a description of such an animal, so I will
content myself with saying his colour was jet
black, without a hair of white either on his face
or feet. For this reason, and the wildness of his
disposition, his master had termed him Apollyon;
a circumstance which was secretly considered as
tending to sanction the evil reports which touched
the house of Arnheim, being, it was said, the
naming of a favourite animal after a foul fiend.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>It chanced, one November day, that the Baron
had been hunting in the forest, and did not reach
home till nightfall. There were no guests with
him, for, as I hinted to you before, the castle of
Arnheim seldom received any other than those
from whom its inhabitants hoped to gain augmentation
of knowledge. The Baron was seated alone
in his hall, illuminated with cressets and torches.
His one hand held a volume covered with characters
unintelligible to all save himself. The other
rested on the marble table, on which was placed a
flask of Tokay wine. A page stood in respectful
attendance near the bottom of the large and dim
apartment, and no sound was heard save that of
the night wind, when it sighed mournfully through
the rusty coats of mail, and waved the tattered
banners which were the tapestry of the feudal hall.
At once the footstep of a person was heard ascending
the stairs in haste and trepidation; the door of
the hall was thrown violently open, and, terrified
to a degree of ecstasy, Caspar, the head of the
Baron's stable, or his master of horse, stumbled up
almost to the foot of the table at which his lord
was seated, with the exclamation in his mouth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord, a fiend is in the stable!"</p>

<p>"What means this folly?" said the Baron, arising,
surprised and displeased at an interruption so
unusual.</p>

<p>"Let me endure your displeasure," said Caspar,
"if I speak not truth! Apollyon"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here he paused.</p>

<p>"Speak out, thou frightened fool," said the
Baron; "is my horse sick, or injured?"</p>

<p>The master of the stalls again gasped forth the
word, "Apollyon!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>"Say on," said the Baron; "were Apollyon in
presence personally, it were nothing to shake a
brave man's mind."</p>

<p>"The devil," answered the master of the horse,
"is in Apollyon's stall!"</p>

<p>"Fool!" exclaimed the nobleman, snatching a
torch from the wall; "what is it that could have
turned thy brain in such silly fashion? Things
like thee, that are born to serve us, should hold
their brains on a firmer tenure, for our sakes, if
not for that of their worthless selves."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he descended to the court of the
castle, to visit the stately range of stables which
occupied all the lower part of the quadrangle on
one side. He entered, where fifty gallant steeds
stood in rows, on each side of the ample hall. At
the side of each stall hung the weapons of offence
and defence of a man-at-arms, as bright as constant
attention could make them, together with
the buff-coat which formed the trooper's under garment.
The Baron, followed by one or two of the
domestics, who had assembled full of astonishment
at the unusual alarm, hastened up to the
head of the stable, betwixt the rows of steeds.
As he approached the stall of his favourite horse,
which was the uppermost of the right-hand row,
the gallant steed neither neighed, nor shook his
head, nor stamped with his foot, nor gave the
usual signs of joy at his lord's approach; a faint
moaning, as if he implored assistance, was the
only acknowledgment he gave of the Baron's
presence.</p>

<p>Sir Herman held up the torch, and discovered
that there was indeed a tall dark figure standing
in the stall, resting his hand on the horse's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
shoulder. "Who art thou," said the Baron, "and
what dost thou here?"</p>

<p>"I seek refuge and hospitality," replied the
stranger; "and I conjure thee to grant it me, by
the shoulder of thy horse, and by the edge of thy
sword, and so as they may never fail thee when
thy need is at the utmost!"</p>

<p>"Thou art, then, a brother of the Sacred Fire,"
said Baron Herman of Arnheim; "and I may not
refuse thee the refuge which thou requirest of me,
after the ritual of the Persian Magi. From whom,
and for what length of time, dost thou crave my
protection?"</p>

<p>"From those," replied the stranger, "who shall
arrive in quest of me before the morning cock
shall crow, and for the full space of a year and a
day from this period."</p>

<p>"I may not refuse thee," said the Baron, "consistently
with my oath and my honour. For a
year and a day I will be thy pledge, and thou
shalt share with me roof and chamber, wine and
food. But thou too must obey the law of Zoroaster,
which, as it says, Let the Stronger protect the
weaker brother, says also, Let the Wiser instruct
the brother who hath less knowledge. I am the
stronger, and thou shalt be safe under my protection;
but thou art the wiser, and must instruct me
in the more secret mysteries."</p>

<p>"You mock your servant," said the strange visitor;
"but if aught is known to Dannischemend
which can avail Herman, his instructions shall be
as those of a father to a son."</p>

<p>"Come forth, then, from thy place of refuge,"
said the Baron of Arnheim. "I swear to thee by
the sacred fire which lives without terrestrial fuel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
and by the fraternity which is betwixt us, and by
the shoulder of my horse, and the edge of my good
sword, I will be thy warrand for a year and a day,
if so far my power shall extend."</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i235" id="i235"></a>
   <img src="images/i-235.jpg" width="364" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">IN THE STABLE.

   <br />
   <span class="s08">Drawn and Etched by R. de los Rios.</span></p></div>

<p>The stranger came forth accordingly; and those
who saw the singularity of his appearance, scarce
wondered at the fears of Caspar, the stall-master,
when he found such a person in the stable, by
what mode of entrance he was unable to conceive.
When he reached the lighted hall to which the
Baron conducted him, as he would have done a
welcome and honoured guest, the stranger appeared
to be very tall, and of a dignified aspect. His
dress was Asiatic, being a long black caftan, or
gown, like that worn by Armenians, and a lofty
square cap, covered with the wool of Astracan
lambs. Every article of the dress was black,
which gave relief to the long white beard, that
flowed down over his bosom. His gown was fastened
by a sash of black silk network, in which,
instead of a poniard or sword, was stuck a silver
case, containing writing-materials, and a roll of
parchment. The only ornament of his apparel
consisted in a large ruby of uncommon brilliancy,
which, when he approached the light, seemed to
glow with such liveliness as if the gem itself had
emitted the rays which it only reflected back.
To the offer of refreshment the stranger replied,
"Bread I may not eat, water shall not moisten my
lips, until the avenger shall have passed by the
threshold."</p>

<p>The Baron commanded the lamps to be trimmed,
and fresh torches to be lighted, and, sending his
whole household to rest, remained seated in the
hall along with the stranger, his suppliant. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
the dead hour of midnight, the gates of the castle
were shaken as by a whirlwind, and a voice, as of
a herald, was heard to demand a herald's lawful
prisoner, Dannischemend, the son of Hali. The
warder then heard a lower window of the hall
thrown open, and could distinguish his master's
voice addressing the person who had thus summoned
the castle. But the night was so dark that
he might not see the speakers, and the language
which they used was either entirely foreign, or so
largely interspersed with strange words, that he
could not understand a syllable which they said.
Scarce five minutes had elapsed, when he who was
without again elevated his voice as before, and
said in German, "For a year and a day, then, I
forbear my forfeiture;&mdash;but coming for it when
that time shall elapse, I come for my right, and
will no longer be withstood."</p>

<p>From that period, Dannischemend, the Persian,
was a constant guest at the castle of Arnheim,
and, indeed, never for any visible purpose crossed
the drawbridge. His amusements, or studies,
seemed centred in the library of the castle, and in
the laboratory, where the Baron sometimes toiled
in conjunction with him for many hours together.
The inhabitants of the castle could find no fault in
the Magus, or Persian, excepting his apparently
dispensing with the ordinances of religion, since
he neither went to mass nor confession, nor
attended upon other religious ceremonies. The
chaplain did indeed profess himself satisfied with
the state of the stranger's conscience; but it had
been long suspected that the worthy ecclesiastic
held his easy office on the very reasonable condition
of approving the principles, and asserting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
orthodoxy, of all guests whom the Baron invited
to share his hospitality.</p>

<p>It was observed that Dannischemend was rigid
in paying his devotions, by prostrating himself in
the first rays of the rising sun, and that he constructed
a silver lamp of the most beautiful proportions,
which he placed on a pedestal, representing
a truncated column of marble, having its base
sculptured with hieroglyphical imagery. With
what essences he fed this flame was unknown to
all, unless perhaps to the Baron; but the flame
was more steady, pure, and lustrous than any
which was ever seen, excepting the sun of heaven
itself, and it was generally believed that the
Magian made it an object of worship in the absence
of that blessed luminary. Nothing else was
observed of him, unless that his morals seemed
severe, his gravity extreme, his general mode of
life very temperate, and his fasts and vigils of frequent
recurrence. Except on particular occasions,
he spoke to no one of the castle but the Baron;
but, as he had money and was liberal, he was
regarded by the domestics with awe indeed, but
without fear or dislike.</p>

<p>Winter was succeeded by spring, summer brought
her flowers, and autumn her fruits, which ripened
and were fading, when a foot-page, who sometimes
attended them in the laboratory to render manual
assistance when required, heard the Persian say
to the Baron of Arnheim, "You will do well, my
son, to mark my words; for my lessons to you are
drawing to an end, and there is no power on earth
which can longer postpone my fate."</p>

<p>"Alas, my master!" said the Baron, "and must
I then lose the benefit of your direction, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
when your guiding hand becomes necessary to
place me on the very pinnacle of the temple of
wisdom?"</p>

<p>"Be not discouraged, my son," answered the
sage; "I will bequeath the task of perfecting you
in your studies to my daughter, who will come
hither on purpose. But remember, if you value
the permanence of your family, look not upon her
as aught else than a helpmate in your studies; for
if you forget the instructress in the beauty of the
maiden, you will be buried with your sword and
your shield, as the last male of your house; and
further evil, believe me, will arise; for such alliances
never come to a happy issue, of which my
own is an example.&mdash;But hush, we are observed."</p>

<p>The household of the castle of Arnheim having
but few things to interest them, were the more
eager observers of those which came under their
notice; and when the termination of the period
when the Persian was to receive shelter in the
castle began to approach, some of the inmates,
under various pretexts, but which resolved into
very terror, absconded, while others held themselves
in expectation of some striking and terrible
catastrophe. None such, however, took place;
and on the expected anniversary, long ere the
witching hour of midnight, Dannischemend terminated
his visit in the castle of Arnheim, by riding
away from the gate in the guise of an ordinary
traveller. The Baron had meantime taken leave
of his tutor with many marks of regret, and some
which amounted even to sorrow. The sage Persian
comforted him by a long whisper, of which
the last part only was heard&mdash;"By the first beam
of sunshine she will be with you. Be kind to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
her, but not over kind." He then departed, and
was never again seen or heard of in the vicinity of
Arnheim.</p>

<p>The Baron was observed during all the day after
the departure of the stranger to be particularly
melancholy. He remained, contrary to his custom,
in the great hall, and neither visited the
library nor the laboratory, where he could no
longer enjoy the company of his departed instructor.
At dawn of the ensuing morning, Sir
Herman summoned his page, and, contrary to his
habits, which used to be rather careless in respect
of apparel, he dressed himself with great accuracy;
and as he was in the prime of life, and of a noble
figure, he had reason to be satisfied with his appearance.
Having performed his toilet, he waited
till the sun had just appeared above the horizon,
and, taking from the table the key of the laboratory,
which the page believed must have lain there
all night, he walked thither, followed by his
attendant. At the door the Baron made a pause,
and seemed at one time to doubt whether he
should not send away the page, at another to hesitate
whether he should open the door, as one might
do who expected some strange sight within. He
pulled up resolution, however, turned the key,
threw the door open, and entered. The page followed
close behind his master, and was astonished
to the point of extreme terror at what he beheld,
although the sight, however extraordinary, had in
it nothing save what was agreeable and lovely.</p>

<p>The silver lamp was extinguished, or removed
from its pedestal, where stood in place of it a most
beautiful female figure in the Persian costume, in
which the colour of pink predominated. But she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
wore no turban or headdress of any kind, saving a
blue riband drawn through her auburn hair, and
secured by a gold clasp, the outer side of which
was ornamented by a superb opal, which, amid the
changing lights peculiar to that gem, displayed
internally a slight tinge of red like a spark of
fire.</p>

<p>The figure of this young person was rather under
the middle size, but perfectly well formed; the
Eastern dress, with the wide trousers gathered
round the ankles, made visible the smallest and
most beautiful feet which had ever been seen,
while hands and arms of the most perfect symmetry
were partly seen from under the folds of the
robe. The little lady's countenance was of a
lively and expressive character, in which spirit
and wit seemed to predominate; and the quick
dark eye, with its beautifully formed eyebrow,
seemed to presage the arch remark to which the
rosy and half-smiling lip appeared ready to give
utterance.</p>

<p>The pedestal on which she stood, or rather was
perched, would have appeared unsafe had any
figure heavier than her own been placed there.
But, however she had been transported thither,
she seemed to rest on it as lightly and safely as a
linnet, when it has dropped from the sky on the
tendril of a rose-bud. The first beam of the rising
sun, falling through a window directly opposite
to the pedestal, increased the effect of this beautiful
figure, which remained as motionless as if it
had been carved in marble. She only expressed
her sense of the Baron of Arnheim's presence by
something of a quicker respiration, and a deep
blush, accompanied by a slight smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever reason the Baron of Arnheim might
have for expecting to see some such object as now
exhibited its actual presence, the degree of beauty
which it presented was so much beyond his expectation,
that for an instant he stood without breath
or motion. At once, however, he seemed to recollect
that it was his duty to welcome the fair
stranger to his castle, and to relieve her from her
precarious situation. He stepped forward accordingly
with the words of welcome on his tongue,
and was extending his arms to lift her from the
pedestal, which was nearly six feet high; but the
light and active stranger merely accepted the support
of his hand, and descended on the floor as
light and as safe as if she had been formed of
gossamer. It was, indeed, only by the momentary
pressure of her little hand that the Baron of
Arnheim was finally made sensible that he had to
do with a being of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>"I am come as I have been commanded," she
said, looking around her. "You must expect a
strict and diligent mistress, and I hope for the
credit of an attentive pupil."</p>

<p>After the arrival of this singular and interesting
being in the castle of Arnheim, various alterations
took place within the interior of the household.
A lady of high rank and small fortune, the
respectable widow of a Count of the Empire, who
was the Baron's blood relation, received and accepted
an invitation to preside over her kinsman's
domestic affairs, and remove, by her countenance,
any suspicions which might arise from the presence
of Hermione, as the beautiful Persian was
generally called.</p>

<p>The Countess Waldstetten carried her complaisance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
so far as to be present on almost all occasions,
whether in the laboratory or library, when
the Baron of Arnheim received lessons from, or
pursued studies with, the young and lovely tutor
who had been thus strangely substituted for the
aged Magus. If this lady's report was to be
trusted, their pursuits were of a most extraordinary
nature, and the results which she sometimes
witnessed were such as to create fear as well as
surprise. But she strongly vindicated them from
practising unlawful arts, or overstepping the boundaries
of natural science.</p>

<p>A better judge of such matters, the Bishop of
Bamberg himself, made a visit to Arnheim, on
purpose to witness the wisdom of which so much
was reported through the whole Rhine-country.
He conversed with Hermione, and found her
deeply impressed with the truths of religion, and
so perfectly acquainted with its doctrines, that he
compared her to a doctor of theology in the dress
of an Eastern dancing-girl. When asked regarding
her knowledge of languages and science, he
answered, that he had been attracted to Arnheim
by the most extravagant reports on these points,
but that he must return confessing "the half
thereof had not been told unto him."</p>

<p>In consequence of this indisputable testimony,
the sinister reports which had been occasioned by
the singular appearance of the fair stranger were
in a great measure lulled to sleep, especially as
her amiable manners won the involuntary good-will
of every one that approached her.</p>

<p>Meantime a marked alteration began to take
place in the interviews between the lovely tutor
and her pupil. These were conducted with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
same caution as before, and never, so far as could
be observed, took place without the presence of the
Countess of Waldstetten, or some other third person
of respectability. But the scenes of these meetings
were no longer the scholar's library, or the chemist's
laboratory;&mdash;the gardens, the groves, were
resorted to for amusement, and parties of hunting
and fishing, with evenings spent in the dance,
seemed to announce that the studies of wisdom
were for a time abandoned for the pursuits of
pleasure. It was not difficult to guess the meaning
of this; the Baron of Arnheim and his fair
guest, speaking a language different from all
others, could enjoy their private conversation,
even amid all the tumult of gaiety around them;
and no one was surprised to hear it formally announced,
after a few weeks of gaiety, that the
fair Persian was to be wedded to the Baron of
Arnheim.</p>

<p>The manners of this fascinating young person
were so pleasing, her conversation so animated,
her wit so keen, yet so well tempered with good
nature and modesty, that, notwithstanding her
unknown origin, her high fortune attracted less
envy than might have been expected in a case so
singular. Above all, her generosity amazed and
won the hearts of all the young persons who approached
her. Her wealth seemed to be measureless,
for the many rich jewels which she distributed
among her fair friends would otherwise have left
her without ornaments for herself. These good
qualities, her liberality above all, together with a
simplicity of thought and character which formed
a beautiful contrast to the depth of acquired knowledge
which she was well known to possess&mdash;these,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
and her total want of ostentation, made her
superiority be pardoned among her companions.
Still there was notice taken of some peculiarities,
exaggerated perhaps by envy, which seemed to
draw a mystical distinction between the beautiful
Hermione and the mere mortals with whom she
lived and conversed.</p>

<p>In the merry dance she was so unrivalled in
lightness and agility that her performance seemed
that of an aërial being. She could, without suffering
from her exertion, continue the pleasure till
she had tired out the most active revellers; and
even the young Duke of Hochspringen, who was
reckoned the most indefatigable at that exercise in
Germany, having been her partner for half an
hour, was compelled to break off the dance, and
throw himself, totally exhausted, on a couch,
exclaiming he had been dancing not with a woman,
but with an <i>ignis fatuus</i>.</p>

<p>Other whispers averred that while she played
with her young companions in the labyrinth and
mazes of the castle gardens at hide-and-seek, or
similar games of activity, she became animated
with the same supernatural alertness which was
supposed to inspire her in the dance. She appeared
amongst her companions, and vanished
from them, with a degree of rapidity which was
inconceivable; and hedges, treillage, or such like
obstructions, were surmounted by her in a manner
which the most vigilant eye could not detect; for,
after being observed on the side of the barrier at
one instant, in another she was beheld close beside
the spectator.</p>

<p>In such moments, when her eyes sparkled, her
cheeks reddened, and her whole frame became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
animated, it was pretended that the opal clasp
amid her tresses, the ornament which she never
laid aside, shot forth the little spark, or tongue of
flame, which it always displayed, with an increased
vivacity. In the same manner, if in the
half-darkened hall the conversation of Hermione
became unusually animated, it was believed that
the jewel became brilliant, and even displayed a
twinkling and flashing gleam which seemed to be
emitted by the gem itself, and not produced in
the usual manner, by the reflection of some external
light. Her maidens were also heard to surmise
that when their mistress was agitated by any
hasty or brief resentment (the only weakness of
temper which she was sometimes observed to display),
they could observe dark-red sparks flash
from the mystic brooch, as if it sympathised with
the wearer's emotions. The women who attended
on her toilet further reported that this gem was
never removed but for a few minutes, when the
Baroness's hair was combed out; that she was
unusually pensive and silent during the time it
was laid aside, and particularly apprehensive
when any liquid was brought near it. Even in
the use of holy water at the door of the church she
was observed to omit the sign of the cross on the
forehead, for fear, it was supposed, of the water
touching the valued jewel.</p>

<p>These singular reports did not prevent the marriage
of the Baron of Arnheim from proceeding as
had been arranged. It was celebrated in the usual
form, and with the utmost splendour, and the
young couple seemed to commence a life of happiness
rarely to be found on earth. In the course of
twelve months, the lovely Baroness presented her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
husband with a daughter, which was to be christened
Sybilla, after the Count's mother. As the
health of the child was excellent, the ceremony
was postponed till the recovery of the mother from
her confinement. Many were invited to be present
on the occasion, and the castle was thronged with
company.</p>

<p>It happened that amongst the guests was an old
lady, notorious for playing in private society the
part of a malicious fairy in a minstrel's tale.
This was the Baroness of Steinfeldt, famous in
the neighbourhood for her insatiable curiosity and
overweening pride. She had not been many days
in the castle, ere, by the aid of a female attendant,
who acted as an intelligencer, she had made herself
mistress of all that was heard, said, or suspected,
concerning the peculiarities of the Baroness
Hermione. It was on the morning of the day
appointed for the christening, while the whole
company were assembled in the hall, and waiting
till the Baroness should appear, to pass with them
to the chapel, that there arose between the censorious
and haughty dame whom we have just
mentioned, and the Countess Waldstetten, a violent
discussion concerning some point of disputed
precedence. It was referred to the Baron von
Arnheim, who decided in favour of the Countess.
Madame de Steinfeldt instantly ordered her palfrey
to be prepared, and her attendants to mount.</p>

<p>"I leave this place," she said, "which a good
Christian ought never to have entered; I leave a
house of which the master is a sorcerer, the mistress
a demon who dares not cross her brow with
holy water, and their trencher companion one
who, for a wretched pittance, is willing to act as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
match-maker between a wizard and an incarnate
fiend!"</p>

<p>She then departed, with rage in her countenance
and spite in her heart.</p>

<p>The Baron of Arnheim then stepped forward,
and demanded of the knights and gentlemen around
if there were any among them who would dare
to make good with his sword the infamous falsehoods
thrown upon himself, his spouse, and his
kinswoman.</p>

<p>There was a general answer, utterly refusing to
defend the Baroness of Steinfeldt's words in so
bad a cause, and universally testifying the belief
of the company that she spoke in the spirit of
calumny and falsehood.</p>

<p>"Then let that lie fall to the ground which no
man of courage will hold up," said the Baron of
Arnheim; "only, all who are here this morning
shall be satisfied whether the Baroness Hermione
doth or doth not share the rites of Christianity."</p>

<p>The Countess of Waldstetten made anxious signs
to him while he spoke thus; and when the crowd
permitted her to approach near him, she was
heard to whisper, "Oh, be not rash! try no experiment!
there is something mysterious about that
opal talisman; be prudent, and let the matter
pass by."</p>

<p>The Baron, who was in a more towering passion
than well became the wisdom to which he made
pretence&mdash;although it will be perhaps allowed
that an affront so public, and in such a time and
place, was enough to shake the prudence of the
most staid, and the philosophy of the most wise&mdash;answered
sternly and briefly, "Are you, too, such
a fool?" and retained his purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>The Baroness of Arnheim at this moment entered
the hall, looking just so pale from her late confinement
as to render her lovely countenance more
interesting, if less animated, than usual. Having
paid her compliments to the assembled company,
with the most graceful and condescending attention,
she was beginning to inquire why Madame
de Steinfeldt was not present, when her husband
made the signal for the company to move forward
to the chapel, and lent the Baroness his arm to
bring up the rear. The chapel was nearly filled
by the splendid company, and all eyes were bent
on their host and hostess, as they entered the place
of devotion immediately after four young ladies,
who supported the infant babe in a light and
beautiful litter.</p>

<p>As they passed the threshold, the Baron dipped
his finger in the font-stone, and offered holy water
to his lady, who accepted it, as usual, by touching
his finger with her own. But then, as if to confute
the calumnies of the malevolent lady of
Steinfeldt, with an air of sportive familiarity
which was rather unwarranted by the time and
place, he flirted on her beautiful forehead a drop
or two of the moisture which remained on his own
hand. The opal, on which one of these drops had
lighted, shot out a brilliant spark like a falling
star, and became the instant afterwards lightless
and colourless as a common pebble, while the
beautiful Baroness sank on the floor of the chapel
with a deep sigh of pain. All crowded around her
in dismay. The unfortunate Hermione was raised
from the ground, and conveyed to her chamber;
and so much did her countenance and pulse alter,
within the short time necessary to do this, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
those who looked upon her pronounced her a dying
woman. She was no sooner in her own apartment
than she requested to be left alone with her husband.
He remained an hour in the room, and
when he came out he locked and double locked
the door behind him. He then betook himself to
the chapel, and remained there for an hour or
more, prostrated before the altar.</p>

<p>In the meantime, most of the guests had dispersed
in dismay, though some abode out of courtesy
or curiosity. There was a general sense of
impropriety in suffering the door of the sick lady's
apartment to remain locked; but, alarmed at the
whole circumstances of her illness, it was some
time ere any one dared disturb the devotions of
the Baron.</p>

<p>At length medical aid arrived, and the Countess
of Waldstetten took upon her to demand the key.
She spoke more than once to a man, who seemed
incapable of hearing, at least of understanding,
what she said. At length he gave her the key,
and added sternly, as he did so, that all aid was
unavailing, and that it was his pleasure that all
strangers should leave the castle. There were few
who inclined to stay, when, upon opening the door
of the chamber in which the Baroness had been
deposited little more than two hours before, no
traces of her could be discovered, unless that there
was about a handful of light-grey ashes, like such
as might have been produced by burning fine
paper, found on the bed where she had been laid.
A solemn funeral was nevertheless performed, with
masses, and all other spiritual rites, for the soul
of the high and noble Lady Hermione of Arnheim;
and it was exactly on that same day three years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
that the Baron himself was laid in the grave of
the same chapel of Arnheim, with sword, shield,
and helmet, as the last male of his family.</p>

<p class="p2">Here the Swiss paused, for they were approaching
the bridge of the castle of Graffs-lust.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i10">Believe me, sir,</p>
<p>It carries a rare form.&mdash;But 'tis a spirit.</p>

<p class="i16"><i>The Tempest.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>There was a short silence after the Bernese had
concluded his singular tale. Arthur Philipson's
attention had been gradually and intensely attracted
by a story which was too much in unison
with the received ideas of the age to be encountered
by the unhesitating incredulity with which it
must have been heard in later and more enlightened
times.</p>

<p>He was also considerably struck by the manner
in which it had been told by the narrator, whom
he had hitherto only regarded in the light of a
rude huntsman or soldier; whereas he now allowed
Donnerhugel credit for a more extensive acquaintance
with the general manners of the world than
he had previously anticipated. The Swiss rose in
his opinion as a man of talent, but without making
the slightest progress in his affections. "The
swashbuckler," he said to himself, "has brains, as
well as brawn and bones, and is fitter for the office
of commanding others than I formerly thought
him." Then, turning to his companion, he
thanked him for the tale, which had shortened
the way in so interesting a manner.</p>

<p>"And it is from this singular marriage," he
continued, "that Anne of Geierstein derives her
origin?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>"Her mother," answered the Swiss, "was Sybilla
of Arnheim, the infant at whose christening
the mother died&mdash;disappeared&mdash;or whatever you
may list to call it. The barony of Arnheim,
being a male fief, reverted to the Emperor. The
castle has never been inhabited since the death of
the last lord, and has, as I have heard, become in
some sort ruinous. The occupations of its ancient
proprietors, and, above all, the catastrophe of its
last inhabitant, have been thought to render it no
eligible place of residence."</p>

<p>"Did there appear anything preternatural," said
the Englishman, "about the young Baroness, who
married the brother of the Landamman?"</p>

<p>"So far as I have heard," replied Rudolph,
"there were strange stories. It was said that the
nurses, at the dead of night, have seen Hermione,
the last Baroness of Arnheim, stand weeping by
the side of the child's cradle, and other things
to the same purpose. But here I speak from less
correct information than that from which I drew
my former narrative."</p>

<p>"And since the credibility of a story, not very
probable in itself, must needs be granted, or withheld,
according to the evidence on which it is given,
may I ask you," said Arthur, "to tell me what is the
authority on which you have so much reliance?"</p>

<p>"Willingly," answered the Swiss. "Know that
Theodore Donnerhugel, the favourite page of the
last Baron of Arnheim, was my father's brother.
Upon his master's death he retired to his native
town of Berne, and most of his time was employed
in training me up to arms and martial exercises,
as well according to the fashion of Germany as of
Switzerland, for he was master of all. He witnessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
with his own eyes, and heard with his own
ears, great part of the melancholy and mysterious
events which I have detailed to you. Should you
ever visit Berne, you may see the good old man."</p>

<p>"You think, then," said Arthur, "that the appearance
which I have this night seen is connected
with the mysterious marriage of Anne of
Geierstein's grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied Rudolph, "think not that I can
lay down any positive explanation of a thing so
strange. I can only say, that unless I did you the
injustice to disbelieve your testimony respecting
the apparition of this evening, I know no way to
account for it, except by remembering that there
is a portion of the young lady's blood which is
thought not to be derived from the race of Adam,
but more or less directly from one of those elementary
spirits which have been talked of both in
ancient and modern times. But I may be mistaken.
We will see how she bears herself in the
morning, and whether she carries in her looks the
weariness and paleness of a midnight watcher. If
she doth not, we may be authorised in thinking,
either that your eyes have strangely deceived you,
or that they have been cheated by some spectral
appearance, which is not of this world."</p>

<p>To this the young Englishman attempted no
reply. Nor was there time for any, for they were
immediately afterwards challenged by the sentinel
from the drawbridge.</p>

<p>The question, "Who goes there?" was twice
satisfactorily answered, before Sigismund would
admit the patrol to cross the drawbridge.</p>

<p>"Ass and mule that thou art," said Rudolph,
"what was the meaning of thy delay?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>"Ass and mule thyself, Hauptman!" said the
Swiss, in answer to this objurgation. "I have
been surprised by a goblin on my post once to-night
already, and I have got so much experience upon
that matter that I will not easily be caught a
second time."</p>

<p>"What goblin, thou fool," said Donnerhugel,
"would be idle enough to play his gambols at the
expense of so very poor an animal as thou art?"</p>

<p>"Thou art as cross as my father, Hauptman,"
replied Sigismund, "who cries fool and blockhead
at every word I speak; and yet I have lips, teeth,
and tongue to speak with, just like other folk."</p>

<p>"We will not contest the matter, Sigismund,"
said Rudolph. "It is clear, that if thou dost
differ from other people, it is in a particular which
thou canst hardly be expected to find out or acknowledge.
But what, in the name of simplicity,
is it which hath alarmed thee on thy post?"</p>

<p>"Marry, thus it was, Hauptman," returned Sigismund
Biederman. "I was something tired,
you see, with looking up at the broad moon, and
thinking what in the universe it could be made
of, and how we came to see it just as well here as
at home, this place being so many miles from
Geierstein. I was tired, I say, of this and other
perplexing thoughts, so I drew my fur cap down
over my ears, for I promise you the wind blew
shrill; and then I planted myself firm on my feet,
with one of my legs a little advanced, and both
my hands resting on my partisan, which I placed
upright before me to rest upon; and so I shut
mine eyes."</p>

<p>"Shut thine eyes, Sigismund, and thou upon
thy watch!" exclaimed Donnerhugel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"Care not thou for that," answered Sigismund;
"I kept my ears open. And yet it was to little
purpose, for something came upon the bridge with
a step as stealthy as that of a mouse. I looked up
with a start at the moment it was opposite to me,
and when I looked up&mdash;whom think you I saw?"</p>

<p>"Some fool like thyself," said Rudolph, at the
same time pressing Philipson's foot to make him
attend to the answer; a hint which was little
necessary, since he waited for it in the utmost
agitation. Out it came at last.</p>

<p>"By St. Mark, it was our own Anne of Geierstein!"</p>

<p>"It is impossible!" replied the Bernese.</p>

<p>"I should have said so too," quoth Sigismund,
"for I had peeped into her bedroom before she
went thither, and it was so bedizened that a queen
or a princess might have slept in it; and why
should the wench get out of her good quarters,
with all her friends about her to guard her, and go
out to wander in the forest?"</p>

<p>"May be," said Rudolph, "she only looked
from the bridge to see how the night waned."</p>

<p>"No," said Sigismund; "she was returning from
the forest. I saw her when she reached the end
of the bridge, and thought of striking at her, conceiving
it to be the devil in her likeness. But I
remembered my halberd is no birch switch to chastise
boys and girls with; and had I done Anne
any harm, you would all have been angry with
me, and, to speak truth, I should have been ill
pleased with myself; for although she doth make
a jest of me now and then, yet it were a dull house
ours were we to lose Anne."</p>

<p>"Ass," answered the Bernese, "didst thou speak
to this form, or goblin as you call it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed I did not, Captain Wiseacre. My
father is ever angry with me when I speak
without thinking, and I could not at that particular
moment think on anything to the purpose.
Neither was there time to think, for she passed me
like a snow-flake upon a whirlwind. I marched
into the castle after her, however, calling on her
by name; so the sleepers were awakened, and men
flew to their arms, and there was as much confusion
as if Archibald of Hagenbach had been among
us with sword and pike. And who should come
out of her little bedroom, as much startled and as
much in a bustle as any of us, but Mrs. Anne
herself! And as she protested she had never
left her room that night, why I, Sigismund
Biederman, was made to stand the whole blame,
as if I could prevent people's ghosts from walking.
But I told her my mind when I saw them all so
set against me. 'And, Mistress Anne,' quoth I,
'it's well known the kindred you come of; and,
after this fair notice, if you send any of your
double-gangers<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> [<a href="#ednote_g" name="enanchor_g" id="enanchor_g" ><i>g</i></a>] to me, let them put iron skull-caps
on their heads, for I will give them the
length and weight of a Swiss halberd, come in
what shape they list.' However, they all cried
'Shame on me!' and my father drove me out
again, with as little remorse as if I had been the
old house-dog, which had stolen in from his watch
to the fireside."</p>

<p>The Bernese replied, with an air of coldness
approaching to contempt, "You have slept on your
watch, Sigismund&mdash;a high military offence, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
you have dreamed while you slept. You were in
good luck that the Landamman did not suspect
your negligence, or, instead of being sent back to
your duty like a lazy watch-dog, you might have
been scourged back like a faithless one to your
kennel at Geierstein, as chanced to poor Ernest
for a less matter."</p>

<p>"Ernest has not yet gone back, though," said
Sigismund, "and I think he may pass as far into
Burgundy as we shall do in this journey. I
pray you, however, Hauptman, to treat me not
dog-like, but as a man, and send some one to
relieve me, instead of prating here in the cold
night air. If there be anything to do to-morrow,
as I well guess there may, a mouthful of food,
and a minute of sleep, will be but a fitting preparative,
and I have stood watch here these two
mortal hours."</p>

<p>With that the young giant yawned portentously,
as if to enforce the reasons of his appeal.</p>

<p>"A mouthful and a minute?" said Rudolph,&mdash;"a
roasted ox, and a lethargy like that of the
Seven Sleepers, would scarce restore you to the use
of your refreshed and waking senses. But I am
your friend, Sigismund, and you are secure in my
favourable report; you shall be instantly relieved,
that you may sleep, if it be possible, without disturbances
from dreams.&mdash;Pass on, young men"
(addressing the others, who by this time had come
up), "and go to your rest. Arthur of England and
I will report to the Landamman and the Banneret
the account of our patrol."</p>

<p>The patrol accordingly entered the castle, and
were soon heard joining their slumbering companions.
Rudolph Donnerhugel seized Arthur's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
arm, and, while they went towards the hall,
whispered in his ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are strange passages!&mdash;How think you
we should report them to the deputation?"</p>

<p>"That I must refer to yourself," said Arthur;
"you are the captain of our watch. I have done
my duty in telling you what I saw&mdash;or thought I
saw&mdash;it is for you to judge how far it is fitting to
communicate it to the Landamman; only, as it
concerns the honour of his family, to his ear alone
I think it should be confided."</p>

<p>"I see no occasion for that," said the Bernese,
hastily; "it cannot affect or interest our general
safety. But I may take occasion hereafter to
speak with Anne on this subject."</p>

<p>This latter hint gave as much pain to Arthur as
the general proposal of silence on an affair so delicate
had afforded him satisfaction. But his uneasiness
was of a kind which he felt it necessary
to suppress, and he therefore replied with as much
composure as he could assume:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will act, Sir Hauptman, as your sense of
duty and delicacy shall dictate. For me, I shall
be silent on what you call the strange passages of
the night, rendered doubly wonderful by the report
of Sigismund Biederman."</p>

<p>"And also on what you have seen and heard concerning
our auxiliaries of Berne?" said Rudolph.</p>

<p>"On that I shall certainly be silent," said
Arthur; "unless thus far, that I mean to communicate
to my father the risk of his baggage being
liable to examination and seizure at La Ferette."</p>

<p>"It is needless," said Rudolph; "I will answer
with head and hand for the safety of everything
belonging to him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"I thank you in his name," said Arthur; "but
we are peaceful travellers, to whom it must be
much more desirable to avoid a broil than to give
occasion for one, even when secure of coming out
of it triumphantly."</p>

<p>"These are the sentiments of a merchant, but
not of a soldier," said Rudolph, in a cold and
displeased tone; "but the matter is your own,
and you must act in it as you think best. Only
remember, if you go to La Ferette without our
assistance, you hazard both goods and life."</p>

<p>They entered, as he spoke, the apartment of
their fellow-travellers. The companions of their
patrol had already laid themselves down amongst
their sleeping comrades at the lower end of the
room. The Landamman and the Bannerman of
Berne heard Donnerhugel make a report, that his
patrol, both before and after midnight, had been
made in safety, and without any encounter which
expressed either danger or suspicion. The Bernese
then wrapped him in his cloak, and, lying down
on the straw, with that happy indifference to accommodation,
and promptitude to seize the moment
of repose, which is acquired by a life of vigilance
and hardship, was in a few minutes fast asleep.</p>

<p>Arthur remained on foot but a little longer, to
dart an earnest look on the door of Anne of Geierstein's
apartment, and to reflect on the wonderful
occurrences of the evening. But they formed a
chaotic mystery, for which he could see no clue,
and the necessity of holding instant communication
with his father compelled him forcibly to turn
his thoughts in that direction. He was obliged to
observe caution and secrecy in accomplishing his
purpose. For this he laid himself down beside his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
parent, whose couch, with the hospitality which
he had experienced from the beginning of his intercourse
with the kind-hearted Swiss, had been
arranged in what was thought the most convenient
place of the apartment, and somewhat apart from
all others. He slept sound, but awoke at the touch
of his son, who whispered to him in English, for
the greater precaution, that he had important
tidings for his private ear.</p>

<p>"An attack on our post?" said the elder Philipson.
"Must we take to our weapons?"</p>

<p>"Not now," said Arthur; "and I pray of you
not to rise or make alarm&mdash;this matter concerns
us alone."</p>

<p>"Tell it instantly, my son," replied his father;
"you speak to one too much used to danger to be
startled at it."</p>

<p>"It is a case for your wisdom to consider," said
Arthur. "I had information, while upon the
patrol, that the Governor of La Ferette will unquestionably
seize upon your baggage and merchandise,
under pretext of levying dues claimed by
the Duke of Burgundy. I have also been informed
that our escort of Swiss youth are determined to
resist this exaction, and conceive themselves possessed
of the numbers and means sufficient to do
so successfully."</p>

<p>"By St. George, that must not be!" said the
elder Philipson. "It would be an evil requital to
the true-hearted Landamman, to give the fiery
Duke a pretext for that war which the excellent
old man is so anxiously desirous to avoid, if it be
possible. Any exactions, however unreasonable, I
will gladly pay. But to have my papers seized on
were utter ruin. I partly feared this, and it made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
me unwilling to join myself to the Landamman's
party. We must now break off from it. This
rapacious governor will not surely lay hands on
the deputation, which seeks his master's court
under protection of the law of nations; but I can
easily see how he might make our presence with
them a pretext for quarrel, which will equally
suit his own avaricious spirit and the humour of
these fiery young men, who are seeking for matter
of offence. This shall not be taken for our sake.
We will separate ourselves from the deputies, and
remain behind till they are passed on. If this De
Hagenbach be not the most unreasonable of men, I
will find a way to content him so far as we are
individually concerned. Meanwhile, I will instantly
wake the Landamman," he said, "and
acquaint him with our purpose."</p>

<p>This was immediately done, for Philipson was
not slow in the execution of his resolutions. In a
minute he was standing by the side of Arnold
Biederman, who, raised on his elbow, was listening
to his communication, while, over the shoulder
of the Landamman, rose the head and long beard
of the deputy from Schwitz, his large clear blue
eyes gleaming from beneath a fur cap, bent on the
Englishman's face, but stealing a glance aside now
and then to mark the impression which what was
said made upon his colleague.</p>

<p>"Good friend and host," said the elder Philipson,
"we have heard for a certainty that our poor
merchandise will be subjected to taxation or seizure
on our passage through La Ferette, and I would
gladly avoid all cause of quarrel, for your sake as
well as our own."</p>

<p>"You do not doubt that we can and will protect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
you?" replied the Landamman. "I tell you,
Englishman, that the guest of a Swiss is as safe
by his side as an eaglet under the wing of its dam;
and to leave us because danger approaches is but a
poor compliment to our courage or constancy. I
am desirous of peace; but not the Duke of Burgundy
himself should wrong a guest of mine, so
far as my power might prevent it."</p>

<p>At this the deputy from Schwitz clenched a fist
like a bull's knuckles, and showed it above the
shoulders of his friend.</p>

<p>"It is even to avoid this, my worthy host,"
replied Philipson, "that I intend to separate from
your friendly company sooner than I desire or purposed.
Bethink you, my brave and worthy host,
you are an ambassador seeking a national peace, I
a trader seeking private gain. War, or quarrels
which may cause war, are alike ruinous to your
purpose and mine. I confess to you frankly, that
I am willing and able to pay a large ransom, and
when you are departed I will negotiate for the
amount. I will abide in the town of Bâle till I
have made fair terms with Archibald de Hagenbach;
and even if he is the avaricious extortioner
you describe him, he will be somewhat moderate
with me rather than run the risk of losing his
booty entirely, by my turning back or taking
another route."</p>

<p>"You speak wisely, Sir Englishman," said the
Landamman; "and I thank you for recalling my
duty to my remembrance. But you must not,
nevertheless, be exposed to danger. So soon as we
move forward, the country will be again open to
the devastations of the Burgundian Riders and
Lanz-knechts, who will sweep the roads in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
direction. The people of Bâle are unhappily too
timorous to protect you; they would yield you up
upon the Governor's first hint; and for justice or
lenity, you might as well expect it in hell as from
Hagenbach."</p>

<p>"There are conjurations, it is said, that can
make hell itself tremble," said Philipson; "and I
have means to propitiate even this De Hagenbach,
providing I can get to private speech with him.
But I own I can expect nothing from his wild
riders, but to be put to death for the value of my
cloak."</p>

<p>"If that be the case," said the Landamman,
"and if you must needs separate from us, for
which I deny not that you have alleged wise and
worthy reasons, wherefore should you not leave
Graffs-lust two hours before us? The roads will
be safe, as our escort is expected; and you will
probably, if you travel early, find De Hagenbach
sober, and as capable as he ever is of hearing reason&mdash;that
is, of perceiving his own interest. But
after his breakfast is washed down with Rhine-wine,
which he drinks every morning before he
hears mass, his fury blinds even his avarice."</p>

<p>"All I want, in order to execute this scheme,"
said Philipson, "is the loan of a mule to carry my
valise, which is packed up with your baggage."</p>

<p>"Take the she-mule," said the Landamman;
"she belongs to my brother here from Schwitz; he
will gladly bestow her on thee."</p>

<p>"If she were worth twenty crowns, and my
comrade Arnold desired me to do so," said the old
whitebeard.</p>

<p>"I will accept her as a loan with gratitude,"
said the Englishman. "But how can you dispense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
with the use of the creature? You have
only one left."</p>

<p>"We can easily supply our want from Bâle,"
said the Landamman. "Nay, we can make this
little delay serve your purpose, Sir Englishman.
I named for our time of departure the first hour
after daybreak; we will postpone it to the second
hour, which will give us enough of time to get a
horse or mule, and you, Sir Philipson, space to
reach La Ferette, where I trust you will have
achieved your business with De Hagenbach to
your contentment, and will join company again
with us as we travel through Burgundy."</p>

<p>"If our mutual objects will permit our travelling
together, worthy Landamman," answered the
merchant, "I shall esteem myself most happy in
becoming the partner of your journey.&mdash;And now
resume the repose which I have interrupted."</p>

<p>"God bless you, wise and true-hearted man,"
said the Landamman, rising and embracing the
Englishman. "Should we never meet again, I
will still remember the merchant who neglected
thoughts of gain, that he might keep the path of
wisdom and rectitude. I know not another who
would not have risked the shedding a lake of
blood to save five ounces of gold.&mdash;Farewell thou
too, gallant young man. Thou hast learned among
us to keep thy foot firm while on the edge of a
Helvetian crag, but none can teach thee so well as
thy father to keep an upright path among the
morasses and precipices of human life."</p>

<p>He then embraced and took a kind farewell of
his friends, in which, as usual, he was imitated
by his friend of Schwitz, who swept with his long
beard the right and left cheeks of both the Englishmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
and again made them heartily welcome
to the use of his mule. All then once more composed
themselves to rest, for the space which
remained before the appearance of the autumnal
dawn.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>The enmity and discord, which of late</p>
<p>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</p>
<p>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,&mdash;</p>
<p>Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</p>
<p>Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</p>
<p>Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.</p>

<p class="i16"><i>Comedy of Errors.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The dawn had scarce begun to touch the distant
horizon, when Arthur Philipson was on foot to prepare
for his father's departure and his own, which,
as arranged on the preceding night, was to take
place two hours before the Landamman and his
attendants proposed to leave the ruinous castle of
Graffs-lust. It was no difficult matter for him to
separate the neatly arranged packages which contained
his father's effects from the clumsy bundles
in which the baggage of the Swiss was deposited.
The one set of mails was made up with the neatness
of men accustomed to long and perilous journeys;
the other, with the rude carelessness of
those who rarely left their home, and who were
altogether inexperienced.</p>

<p>A servant of the Landamman assisted Arthur in
this task, and in placing his father's baggage on
the mule belonging to the bearded deputy from
Schwitz. From this man also he received instructions
concerning the road from Graffs-lust to
Brisach (the chief citadel of La Ferette), which
was too plain and direct to render it likely that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
they should incur any risk of losing their way, as
had befallen them when travelling on the Swiss
mountains. Everything being now prepared for
their departure, the young Englishman awakened
his father, and acquainted him that all was ready.
He then retired towards the chimney, while his
father, according to his daily custom, repeated the
prayer of St. Julian, the patron of travellers, and
adjusted his dress for the journey.</p>

<p>It will not be wondered at, that, while the
father went through his devotions, and equipped
himself for travel, Arthur, with his heart full of
what he had seen of Anne of Geierstein for some
time before, and his brain dizzy with the recollection
of the incidents of the preceding night, should
have kept his eyes riveted on the door of the sleeping-apartment
at which he had last seen that
young person disappear; that is, unless the pale
and seemingly fantastic form which had twice
crossed him so strangely should prove no wandering
spirit of the elements, but the living substance
of the person whose appearance it bore. So eager
was his curiosity on this subject, that he strained
his eyes to the utmost, as if it had been possible
for them to have penetrated through wood and
walls into the chamber of the slumbering maiden,
in order to discover whether her eye or cheek bore
any mark that she had last night been a watcher
or a wanderer.</p>

<p>"But that was the proof to which Rudolph
appealed," he said internally, "and Rudolph alone
will have the opportunity of remarking the result.
Who knows what advantage my communication
may give him in his suit with yonder lovely creature?
And what must she think of me, save as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
one light of thought and loose of tongue, to whom
nothing extraordinary can chance, but he must
hasten to babble it into the ears of those who are
nearest to him at the moment? I would my
tongue had been palsied ere I said a syllable to
yonder proud yet wily prize-fighter! I shall never
see her more&mdash;that is to be counted for certain.
I shall never know the true interpretation of those
mysteries which hang around her. But to think
I may have prated something tending to throw her
into the power of yonder ferocious boor will be a
subject of remorse to me while I live."</p>

<p>Here he was startled out of his reverie by the
voice of his father. "Why, how now, boy? Art
thou waking, Arthur, or sleeping on thy feet from
the fatigue of last night's service?"</p>

<p>"Not so, my father," answered Arthur, at once
recollecting himself. "Somewhat drowsy, perhaps;
but the fresh morning air will soon put that to
flight."</p>

<p>Walking with precaution through the group of
sleepers who lay around, the elder Philipson, when
they had gained the door of the apartment, turned
back, and, looking on the straw couch which the
large form of the Landamman, and the silvery
beard of his constant companion, touched by the
earliest beams of light, distinguished as that of
Arnold Biederman, he muttered between his lips
an involuntary adieu.</p>

<p>"Farewell, mirror of ancient faith and integrity,&mdash;farewell,
noble Arnold,&mdash;farewell, soul of
truth and candour&mdash;to whom cowardice, selfishness,
and falsehood are alike unknown!"</p>

<p>And farewell, thought his son, to the loveliest,
and most candid, yet most mysterious of maidens!&mdash;But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the adieu, as may well be believed, was
not, like that of his father, expressed in words.</p>

<p>They were soon after on the outside of the gate.
The Swiss domestic was liberally recompensed,
and charged with a thousand kind words of farewell
and of remembrance to the Landamman from
his English guests, mingled with hopes and wishes
that they might soon meet again in the Burgundian
territory. The young man then took the
bridle of the mule, and led the animal forward on
their journey at an easy pace, his father walking
by his side.</p>

<p>After a silence of some minutes, the elder
Philipson addressed Arthur. "I fear me," he
said, "we shall see the worthy Landamman no
more. The youths who attend him are bent upon
taking offence&mdash;the Duke of Burgundy will not
fail, I fear, to give them ample occasion&mdash;and the
peace which the excellent man desires for the land
of his fathers will be shipwrecked ere they reach
the Duke's presence; though, even were it otherwise,
how the proudest prince in Europe will brook
the moody looks of burgesses and peasants (so will
Charles of Burgundy term the friends we have
parted from) is a question too easily answered.
A war, fatal to the interests of all concerned, save
Louis of France, will certainly take place; and
dreadful must be the contest, if the ranks of the
Burgundian chivalry shall encounter those iron
sons of the mountains, before whom so many of the
Austrian nobility have been repeatedly prostrated."</p>

<p>"I am so much convinced of the truth of what
you say, my father," replied Arthur, "that I judge
even this day will not pass over without a breach
of truce. I have already put on my shirt of mail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
in case we should meet bad company betwixt
Graffs-lust and Brisach; and I would to Heaven
that you would observe the same precaution. It
will not delay our journey; and I confess to you,
that I, at least, will travel with much greater
consciousness of safety should you do so."</p>

<p>"I understand you, my son," replied the elder
Philipson. "But I am a peaceful traveller in the
Duke of Burgundy's territories, and must not
willingly suppose that, while under the shadow of
his banner, I must guard myself against banditti,
as if I were in the wilds of Palestine. As for the
authority of his officers, and the extent of their
exactions, I need not tell you that they are, in our
circumstances, things to be submitted to without
grief or grudging."</p>

<p>Leaving the two travellers to journey towards
Brisach at their leisure, I must transport my
readers to the eastern gate of that small town,
which, situated on an eminence, had a commanding
prospect on every side, but especially towards
Bâle. It did not properly make a part of the
dominions of the Duke of Burgundy, but had been
placed in his hands in pawn, or in pledge, for the
repayment of a considerable sum of money, due to
Charles by the Emperor Sigismund of Austria, to
whom the seigniory of the place belonged in property.
But the town lay so conveniently for distressing
the commerce of the Swiss, and inflicting
on that people, whom he at once hated and despised,
similar marks of his malevolence, as to encourage
a general opinion, that the Duke of Burgundy,
the implacable and unreasonable enemy of these
mountaineers, would never listen to any terms of
redemption, however equitable or advantageous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
which might have the effect of restoring to the
Emperor an advanced post of such consequence to
the gratification of his dislike as Brisach.</p>

<p>The situation of the little town was in itself
strong, but the fortifications which surrounded it
were barely sufficient to repel any sudden attack,
and not adequate to resist for any length of time
a formal siege. The morning beams had shone on
the spire of the church for more than an hour,
when a tall, thin, elderly man, wrapped in a
morning gown, over which was buckled a broad
belt, supporting on the left side a sword, on the
right a dagger, approached the barbican of the
eastern gate. His bonnet displayed a feather,
which, or the tail of a fox in lieu of it, was the
emblem of gentle blood throughout all Germany,
and a badge highly prized by those who had a
right to wear it.</p>

<p>The small party of soldiers who had kept watch
there during the course of the preceding night, and
supplied sentinels both for ward and outlook, took
arms on the appearance of this individual, and
drew themselves up in the form of a guard, which
receives with military reverence an officer of importance.
Archibald de Hagenbach's countenance,
for it was the Governor himself, expressed that settled
peevishness and ill temper which characterise
the morning hours of a valetudinary debauchee.
His head throbbed, his pulse was feverish, and
his cheek was pale&mdash;symptoms of his having
spent the last night, as was his usual custom,
amid wine-stoups and flagons. Judging from the
haste with which his soldiers fell into their ranks,
and the awe and silence which reigned among
them, it appeared that they were accustomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
expect and dread his ill humour on such occasions.
He glanced at them, accordingly, an inquisitive
and dissatisfied look, as if he sought something on
which to vent his peevishness, and then asked for
the "loitering dog Kilian."</p>

<p>Kilian presently made his appearance, a stout
hard-favoured man-at-arms, a Bavarian by birth,
and by rank the personal squire of the Governor.</p>

<p>"What news of the Swiss churls, Kilian?"
demanded Archibald de Hagenbach. "They should,
by their thrifty habits, have been on the road two
hours since. Have the peasant-clods presumed to
ape the manners of gentlemen, and stuck by the
flask till cock-crow?"</p>

<p>"By my faith, it may well be," answered Kilian;
"the burghers of Bâle gave them full means
of carousal."</p>

<p>"How, Kilian?&mdash;They dared not offer hospitality
to the Swiss drove of bullocks, after the
charge we sent them to the contrary?"</p>

<p>"Nay, the Bâlese received them not into the
town," replied the squire; "but I learned, by sure
espial, that they afforded them means of quartering
at Graffs-lust, which was furnished with many
a fair gammon and pasty, to speak naught of flasks
of Rhine-wine, barrels of beer, and stoups of strong
waters."</p>

<p>"The Bâlese shall answer this, Kilian," said the
Governor. "Do they think I am for ever to be
thrusting myself between the Duke and his pleasure
on their behalf?&mdash;The fat porkers have presumed
too much since we accepted some trifling
gifts at their hands, more for gracing of them,
than for any advantage we could make of their
paltry donations. Was it not the wine from Bâle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
which we were obliged to drink out in pint goblets,
lest it should become sour before morning?"</p>

<p>"It was drunk out, and in pint goblets too,"
said Kilian; "so much I can well remember."</p>

<p>"Why, go to, then," said the Governor; "they
shall know, these beasts of Bâle, that I hold myself
no way obliged by such donations as these, and
that my remembrance of the wines which I carouse
rests no longer than the headache which the mixtures
they drug me with never fail of late years to
leave behind, for the next morning's pastime."</p>

<p>"Your excellency," replied the squire, "will
make it, then, a quarrel between the Duke of
Burgundy and the city of Bâle, that they gave
this indirect degree of comfort and assistance to
the Swiss deputation?"</p>

<p>"Ay, marry will I," said De Hagenbach, "unless
there be wise men among them, who shall
show me good reasons for protecting them. Oh,
the Bâlese do not know our Noble Duke, nor the
gift he hath for chastising the gutter-blooded citizens
of a free town. Thou canst tell them, Kilian,
as well as any man, how he dealt with the villains
of Liège, when they would needs be pragmatical."</p>

<p>"I will apprise them of the matter," said Kilian,
"when opportunity shall serve, and I trust I shall
find them in a temper disposed to cultivate your
honourable friendship."</p>

<p>"Nay, if it is the same to them, it is quite indifferent
to me, Kilian," continued the Governor;
"but, methinks, whole and sound throats are
worth some purchase, were it only to swallow
black-puddings and schwarz-beer, to say nothing
of Westphalian hams and Nierensteiner&mdash;I say, a
slashed throat is a useless thing, Kilian."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>"I will make the fat citizens to understand
their danger, and the necessity of making interest,"
answered Kilian. "Sure, I am not now to
learn how to turn the ball into your excellency's
lap."</p>

<p>"You speak well," said Sir Archibald;&mdash;"but
how chanced it thou hast so little to say to
the Switzers' leaguer? I should have thought an
old trooper like thee would have made their
pinions flutter amidst the good cheer thou tellest
me of."</p>

<p>"I might as well have annoyed an angry hedgehog
with my bare finger," said Kilian. "I surveyed
Graffs-lust myself;&mdash;there were sentinels
on the castle walls, a sentinel on the bridge,
besides a regular patrol of these Swiss fellows who
kept strict watch. So that there was nothing to
be done, otherwise, knowing your excellency's
ancient quarrel, I would have had a hit at them,
when they should never have known who hurt
them. I will tell you, however, fairly, that these
churls are acquiring better knowledge in the art of
war than the best Ritter knight."</p>

<p>"Well, they will be the better worth the looking
after when they arrive," said De Hagenbach;
"they come forth in state doubtless, with all their
finery, their wives' chains of silver, their own
medals, and rings of lead and copper.&mdash;Ah, the
base hinds, they are unworthy that a man of noble
blood should ease them of their trash!"</p>

<p>"There is better ware among them, if my intelligence
hath not deceived me," replied Kilian;
"there are merchants"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pshaw! the packhorses of Berne and Soleure,"
said the Governor, "with their paltry lumber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
cloth too coarse to make covers for horses of any
breeding, and linen that is more like hair-cloth
than any composition of flax. I will strip them,
however, were it but to vex the knaves. What!
not content with claiming to be treated like an
independent people, and sending forth deputies
and embassies forsooth, they expect, I warrant, to
make the indemnities of ambassadors cover the
introduction of a cargo of their contraband commodities,
and thus insult the noble Duke of
Burgundy, and cheat him at the same time? But
De Hagenbach is neither knight nor gentleman if
he allow them to pass unchallenged."</p>

<p>"And they are better worth being stopped," said
Kilian, "than your excellency supposes; for they
have English merchants along with them, and
under their protection."</p>

<p>"English merchants!" exclaimed De Hagenbach,
his eyes sparkling with joy; "English merchants,
Kilian! Men talk of Cathay and Ind,
where there are mines of silver, and gold, and diamonds;
but, on the faith of a gentleman, I believe
these brutish Islanders have the caves of treasure
wholly within their own foggy land! And then
the variety of their rich merchandise,&mdash;Ha,
Kilian! is it a long train of mules&mdash;a jolly tinkling
team?&mdash;By Our Lady's glove! the sound of it
is already jingling in my ears, more musically
than all the harps of all the minne-singers at
Heilbron!"</p>

<p>"Nay, my lord, there is no great train," replied
the squire;&mdash;"only two men, as I am given to
understand, with scarce so much baggage as loads
a mule; but, it is said, of infinite value, silk and
samite, lace and furs, pearls and jewellery-work&mdash;perfumes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
from the East, and gold-work from
Venice."</p>

<p>"Raptures and paradise! say not a word more,"
exclaimed the rapacious knight of Hagenbach;
"they are all our own, Kilian! Why, these are
the very men I have dreamed of twice a week for
this month past&mdash;ay, two men of middle stature,
or somewhat under it&mdash;with smooth, round, fair,
comely visages, having stomachs as plump as
partridges, and purses as plump as their stomachs&mdash;Ha,
what say'st thou to my dream, Kilian?"</p>

<p>"Only, that, to be quite soothfast," answered
the squire, "it should have included the presence
of a score, or thereabouts, of sturdy young giants
as ever climbed cliff, or carried bolt to whistle at
a chamois&mdash;a lusty plump of clubs, bills, and
partisans, such as make shields crack like oaten
cakes, and helmets ring like church-bells."</p>

<p>"The better, knave, the better!" exclaimed the
Governor, rubbing his hands. "English pedlars
to plunder! Swiss bullies to beat into submission!
I wot well, we can have nothing of the
Helvetian swine save their beastly bristles&mdash;it is
lucky they bring these two island sheep along
with them. But we must get ready our boar-spears,
and clear the clipping-pens for exercise of
our craft.&mdash;Here, Lieutenant Schonfeldt!"</p>

<p>An officer stepped forth.</p>

<p>"How many men are here on duty?"</p>

<p>"About sixty," replied the officer. "Twenty
out on parties in different directions, and there
may be forty or fifty in their quarters."</p>

<p>"Order them all under arms instantly;&mdash;hark
ye, not by trumpet or bugle, but by warning them
individually in their quarters, to draw to arms as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
quietly as possible, and rendezvous here at the
eastern gate. Tell the villains there is booty to
be gained, and they shall have their share."</p>

<p>"On these terms," said Schonfeldt, "they will
walk over a spider's web without startling the
insect that wove it. I will collect them without
loss of an instant."</p>

<p>"I tell thee, Kilian," continued the exulting
commandant, again speaking apart with his confidential
attendant, "nothing could come so luckily
as the chance of this onslaught. Duke Charles
desires to affront the Swiss,&mdash;not, look you, that
he cares to act towards them by his own direct
orders, in such a manner as might be termed a
breach of public faith towards a peaceful embassy;
but the gallant follower who shall save his prince
the scandal of such an affair, and whose actions
may be termed a mistake or misapprehension,
shall, I warrant you, be accounted to have done
knightly service. Perchance a frown may be
passed upon him in public, but in private the
Duke will know how to esteem him.&mdash;Why
standest thou so silent, man, and what ails thy
ugly ill-looking aspect? Thou art not afraid of
twenty Switzer boys, and we at the head of such
a band of spears?"</p>

<p>"The Swiss," answered Kilian, "will give and
take good blows, yet I have no fear of them. But
I like not that we should trust too much to Duke
Charles. That he would be, in the first instance,
pleased with any dishonour done the Swiss is
likely enough; but if, as your excellency hints,
he finds it afterwards convenient to disown the
action, he is a prince likely to give a lively colour
to his disavowal by hanging up the actors."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said the commandant, "I know
where I stand. Such a trick were like enough to
be played by Louis of France, but it is foreign to
the blunt character of our Bold one of Burgundy.&mdash;Why
the devil stand'st thou still, man, simpering
like an ape at a roasted chestnut, which
he thinks too warm for his fingers?"</p>

<p>"Your excellency is wise as well as warlike,"
said the esquire, "and it is not for me to contest
your pleasure. But this peaceful embassy&mdash;these
English merchants&mdash;if Charles goes to war with
Louis, as the rumour is current, what he should
most of all desire is the neutrality of Switzerland,
and the assistance of England, whose King is
crossing the sea with a great army. Now you, Sir
Archibald of Hagenbach, may well do that in the
course of this very morning which will put the
Confederated Cantons in arms against Charles, and
turn the English from allies into enemies."</p>

<p>"I care not," said the commandant; "I know the
Duke's humour well, and if he, the master of so
many provinces, is willing to risk them in a self-willed
frolic, what is it to Archibald de Hagenbach,
who has not a foot of land to lose in the
cause?"</p>

<p>"But you have life, my lord," said the esquire.</p>

<p>"Ay, life!" replied the knight; "a paltry right
to exist, which I have been ready to stake every
day of my life for dollars&mdash;ay, and for kreutzers&mdash;and
think you I will hesitate to pledge it for
broad-pieces, jewels of the East, and goldsmith's
work of Venice? No, Kilian; these English must
be eased of their bales, that Archibald de Hagenbach
may drink a purer flask than their thin
Moselle, and wear a brocade doublet instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
greasy velvet. Nor is it less necessary that Kilian
should have a seemly new jerkin, with a purse of
ducats to jingle at his girdle."</p>

<p>"By my faith," said Kilian, "that last argument
hath disarmed my scruples, and I give up
the point, since it ill befits me to dispute with
your excellency."</p>

<p>"To the work then," said his leader. "But stay&mdash;we
must first take the church along with us.
The Priest of St. Paul's hath been moody of late,
and spread abroad strange things from the pulpit,
as if we were little better than common pillagers
and robbers. Nay, he hath had the insolence to
warn me, as he termed it, twice, in strange form.
It were well to break the growling mastiff's bald
head; but since that might be ill taken by the
Duke, the next point of wisdom is to fling him
a bone."</p>

<p>"He may be a dangerous enemy," said the
squire dubiously; "his power is great with the
people."</p>

<p>"Tush!" replied Hagenbach, "I know how to
disarm the shaveling. Send to him, and tell him
to come hither to speak with me. Meanwhile
have all our force under arms; let the barbican
and barrier be well manned with archers; station
spearmen in the houses on each hand of the gateway;
and let the street be barricaded with carts,
well bound together, but placed as if they had
been there by accident&mdash;place a body of determined
fellows in these carts, and behind them.
So soon as the merchants and their mules enter
(for that is the main point), up with your drawbridge,
down with the portcullis, send a volley of
arrows among those who are without, if they make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
any scuffle; disarm and secure those who have
entered, and are cooped up between the barricade
before, and the ambush behind and around them&mdash;And
<i>then</i>, Kilian"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And then," said his esquire, "shall we, like
merry Free Companions, be knuckle deep in the
English budgets"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And, like jovial hunters," replied the knight,
"elbow-deep in Swiss blood."</p>

<p>"The game will stand at bay though," answered
Kilian. "They are led by that Donnerhugel whom
we have heard of, whom they call the Young Bear
of Berne. They will turn to their defence."</p>

<p>"The better, man&mdash;wouldst thou kill sheep
rather than hunt wolves? Besides, our toils are
set, and the whole garrison shall assist. Shame
on thee, Kilian, thou wert not wont to have so
many scruples!"</p>

<p>"Nor have I now," said Kilian. "But these
Swiss bills, and two-handed swords of the breadth
of four inches, are no child's play.&mdash;And then if
you call all our garrison to the attack, to whom
will your excellency intrust the defence of the
other gates, and the circuit of the walls?"</p>

<p>"Lock, bolt, and chain up the gates," replied
the Governor, "and bring the keys hither. There
shall no one leave the place till this affair is over.
Let some score of the citizens take arms for the
duty of guarding the walls; and look they discharge
it well, or I will lay a fine on them which
they shall discharge to purpose."</p>

<p>"They will grumble," said Kilian. "They say,
that not being the Duke's subjects, though the
place is impledged to his Grace, they are not liable
to military service."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>"They lie! the cowardly slaves," answered De
Hagenbach. "If I have not employed them much
hitherto, it is because I scorn their assistance;
nor would I now use their help, were it for anything
save to keep a watch, by looking out straight
before them. Let them obey, as they respect their
property, persons, and families."</p>

<p>A deep voice behind them repeated the emphatic
language of Scripture,&mdash;"I have seen the wicked
man flourish in his power even like unto a laurel,
but I returned and he was not&mdash;yea, I sought
him, but he was not to be found."</p>

<p>Sir Archibald de Hagenbach turned sternly, and
encountered the dark and ominous looks of the
Priest of St. Paul's, dressed in the vestments of
his order.</p>

<p>"We are busy, father," said the Governor, "and
will hear your preachment another time."</p>

<p>"I come by your summons, Sir Governor," said
the priest, "or I had not intruded myself where I
well knew my preachments, if you term them so,
will do no good."</p>

<p>"Oh, I crave your mercy, reverend father," said
De Hagenbach. "Yes, it is true that I did send
for you, to desire your prayers and kind intercession
with Our Lady and St. Paul, in some transactions
which are likely to occur this morning, and
in which, as the Lombard says, I do espy <i>roba di
guadagno</i>."</p>

<p>"Sir Archibald," answered the priest calmly,
"I well hope and trust that you do not forget the
nature of the glorified Saints so far as to ask them
for their blessing upon such exploits as you have
been too oft engaged in since your arrival amongst
us&mdash;an event which of itself gave token of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
divine anger. Nay, let me say, humble as I am,
that decency to a servant of the altar should check
you from proposing to me to put up prayers for the
success of pillage and robbery."</p>

<p>"I understand you, father," said the rapacious
Governor, "and you shall see I do. While you
are the Duke's subject, you must by your office
put up your prayers for his success in matters that
are fairly managed. You acknowledge this with
a graceful bend of your reverend head? Well,
then, I will be as reasonable as you are. Say we
desire the intercession of the good Saints, and of
you, their pious orator, in something a little out
of the ordinary path, and, if you will, somewhat
of a doubtful complexion,&mdash;are we entitled to ask
you or them for their pains and trouble without a
just consideration? Surely no. Therefore I vow
and solemnly promise, that if I have good fortune
in this morning's adventure, St. Paul shall have
an altar-cloth and a basin of silver, large or little,
as my booty will permit&mdash;Our Lady a web of satin
for a full suit, with a necklace of pearl for holidays&mdash;and
thou, priest, some twenty pieces of
broad English gold, for acting as go-between betwixt
ourselves and the blessed Apostles, whom
we acknowledge ourselves unworthy to negotiate
with in our profane person. And now, Sir Priest,
do we understand each other, for I have little time
to lose? I know you have hard thoughts of me,
but you see the devil is not quite so horrible as he
is painted."</p>

<p>"Do we understand each other?" answered the
Black Priest of St. Paul's, repeating the Governor's
question&mdash;"Alas, no! and I fear me we
never shall. Hast thou never heard the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
spoken by the holy hermit, Berchtold of Offringen,
to the implacable Queen Agnes, who had revenged
with such dreadful severity the assassination of
her father, the Emperor Albert?"</p>

<p>"Not I," returned the knight; "I have neither
studied the chronicles of emperors, nor the legends
of hermits; and therefore, Sir Priest, an you like
not my proposal, let us have no further words on
the matter. I am unwont to press my favours, or
to deal with priests who require entreaty, when
gifts are held out to them."</p>

<p>"Hear yet the words of the holy man," said the
priest. "The time may come, and that shortly,
when you would gladly desire to hear what you
scornfully reject."</p>

<p>"Speak on, but be brief," said Archibald de
Hagenbach; "and know, though thou mayst terrify
or cajole the multitude, thou now speakest to one
whose resolution is fixed far beyond the power of
thy eloquence to melt."</p>

<p>"Know, then," said the Priest of St. Paul's,
"that Agnes, daughter of the murdered Albert,
after shedding oceans of blood in avenging his
bloody death, founded at length the rich abbey of
Königsfeldt; and, that it might have a superior
claim to renowned sanctity, made a pilgrimage in
person to the cell of the holy hermit, and besought
of him to honour her abbey by taking up his residence
there. But what was his reply?&mdash;Mark it
and tremble. 'Begone, ruthless woman,' said the
holy man; 'God will not be served with blood-guiltiness,
and rejects the gifts which are obtained
by violence and robbery. The Almighty loves
mercy, justice, and humanity, and by the lovers
of these only will He be worshipped.' And now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Archibald of Hagenbach, once, twice, thrice, hast
thou had warning. Live as becomes a man on
whom sentence is passed, and who must expect
execution."</p>

<p>Having spoken these words with a menacing
tone and frowning aspect, the Priest of St.
Paul's turned away from the Governor, whose first
impulse was to command him to be arrested. But
when he recollected the serious consequences which
attached to the laying violent hands on a priest,
he suffered him to depart in peace, conscious that
his own unpopularity might render any attempt
to revenge himself an act of great rashness. He
called, therefore, for a beaker of Burgundy, in
which he swallowed down his displeasure, and
had just returned to Kilian the cup, which he had
drained to the bottom, when the warden winded a
blast from the watch-tower, which betokened the
arrival of strangers at the gate of the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>I will resist such entertainment, till</p>
<p>My enemy has more power.</p>

<p class="i16"><i>The Tempest.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>"That blast was but feebly blown," said De
Hagenbach, ascending to the ramparts, from which
he could see what passed on the outside of the
gate. "Who approaches, Kilian?"</p>

<p>The trusty squire was hastening to meet him
with the news.</p>

<p>"Two men with a mule, an it please your excellency;
and merchants, I presume them to be."</p>

<p>"Merchants? 'Sdeath, villain! pedlars you mean.
Heard ever man of English merchants tramping it
on foot, with no more baggage than one mule can
manage to carry? They must be beggarly Bohemians,
or those whom the French people call
Escossais. The knaves! they shall pay with the
pining of their paunches for the poverty of their
purses."</p>

<p>"Do not be too hasty, an please your excellency,"
quoth the squire; "small budgets hold rich
goods. But, rich or poor, they are our men, at
least they have all the marks&mdash;the elder, well-sized
and dark-visaged, may write fifty and five
years, a beard somewhat grizzled;&mdash;the younger,
some two-and-twenty, taller than the first, and a
well-favoured lad, with a smooth chin and light-brown
mustaches."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"Let them be admitted," said the Governor,
turning back in order again to descend to the
street, "and bring them into the folter-kammer of
the toll-house."</p>

<p>So saying, he betook himself to the place appointed,
which was an apartment in the large
tower that protected the eastern gateway, in which
were deposited the rack, with various other instruments
of torture, which the cruel and rapacious
Governor was in the habit of applying to such
prisoners from whom he was desirous of extorting
either booty or information. He entered the
apartment, which was dimly lighted, and had a
lofty Gothic roof which could be but imperfectly
seen, while nooses and cords hanging down from
thence announced a fearful connection with various
implements of rusted iron that hung round the
walls or lay scattered on the floor.</p>

<p>A faint stream of light through one of the
numerous and narrow slits, or shot-holes, with
which the walls were garnished, fell directly upon
the person and visage of a tall swarthy man, seated
in what, but for the partial illumination, would
have been an obscure corner of this evil-boding
apartment. His features were regular, and even
handsome, but of a character peculiarly stern and
sinister. This person's dress was a cloak of scarlet;
his head was bare, and surrounded by shaggy
locks of black, which time had partly grizzled.
He was busily employed in furbishing and burnishing
a broad two-handed sword, of a peculiar
shape, and considerably shorter than the weapons
of that kind which we have described as used by
the Swiss. He was so deeply engaged in his task,
that he started as the heavy door opened with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
jarring noise, and the sword, escaping from his
hold, rolled on the stone floor with a heavy clash.</p>

<p>"Ha! Scharfgerichter," said the Knight, as he
entered the folter-kammer, "thou art preparing for
thy duty?"</p>

<p>"It would ill become your excellency's servant,"
answered the man, in a harsh deep tone,
"to be found idle. But the prisoner is not far off,
as I can judge by the fall of my sword, which
infallibly announces the presence of him who
shall feel its edge."</p>

<p>"The prisoners are at hand, Francis," replied
the Governor; "but thy omen has deceived thee
for once. They are fellows for whom a good rope
will suffice, and thy sword drinks only noble
blood."</p>

<p>"The worse for Francis Steinernherz," replied
the official in scarlet: "I trusted that your excellency,
who have ever been a bountiful patron,
should this day have made me noble."</p>

<p>"Noble!" said the Governor; "thou art mad&mdash;Thou
noble! The common executioner!"</p>

<p>"And wherefore not, Sir Archibald de Hagenbach?
I think the name of Francis Steinernherz
<i>von</i> Blut-acker will suit nobility, being fairly and
legally won, as well as another. Nay, do not stare
on me thus. If one of my profession shall do his
grim office on nine men of noble birth, with the
same weapon, and with a single blow to each
patient, hath he not a right to his freedom from
taxes, and his nobility by patent?"</p>

<p>"So says the law," said Sir Archibald, after
reflecting for a moment,&mdash;"but rather more in
scorn than seriously, I should judge, since no one
was ever known to claim the benefit of it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>"The prouder boast for him," said the functionary,
"that shall be the first to demand the
honours due to a sharp sword and a clean stroke.
I, Francis Steinernherz, will be the first noble of
my profession, when I shall have despatched one
more knight of the Empire."</p>

<p>"Thou hast been ever in <i>my</i> service, hast thou
not?" demanded De Hagenbach.</p>

<p>"Under what other master," replied the executioner,
"could I have enjoyed such constant practice?
I have executed your decrees on condemned
sinners since I could swing a scourge, lift a crowbar,
or wield this trusty weapon; and who can say
I ever failed of my first blow, or needed to deal a
second? Tristrem of the Hospital, and his famous
assistants, Petit André and Trois Eschelles, are
novices compared with me in the use of the noble
and knightly sword. Marry, I should be ashamed
to match myself with them in the field practice
with bowstring and dagger; these are no feats
worthy of a Christian man who would rise to
honour and nobility."</p>

<p>"Thou art a fellow of excellent address, and I
do not deny it," replied De Hagenbach. "But it
cannot be&mdash;I trust it cannot be&mdash;that when noble
blood is becoming scarce in the land, and proud
churls are lording it over knights and barons, I
myself should have caused so much to be spilled?"</p>

<p>"I will number the patients to your excellency
by name and title," said Francis, drawing out a
scroll of parchment, and reading with a commentary
as he went on,&mdash;"There was Count William
of Elvershoe&mdash;he was my assay-piece, a sweet
youth, and died most like a Christian."</p>

<p>"I remember&mdash;he was indeed a most smart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
youth, and courted my mistress," said Sir Archibald.</p>

<p>"He died on St. Jude's, in the year of grace
1455," said the executioner.</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;but name no dates," said the Governor.</p>

<p>"Sir Miles of Stockenborg"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"He drove off my cattle," observed his excellency.</p>

<p>"Sir Louis of Riesenfeldt"&mdash;continued the
executioner.</p>

<p>"He made love to my wife," commented the
Governor.</p>

<p>"The three Yung-herren of Lammerbourg&mdash;you
made their father, the Count, childless in one
day."</p>

<p>"And he made me landless," said Sir Archibald,
"so that account is settled.&mdash;Thou needest
read no further," he continued: "I admit thy
record, though it is written in letters somewhat
of the reddest. I had counted these three young
gentlemen as one execution."</p>

<p>"You did me the greater wrong," said Francis;
"they cost three good separate blows of this good
sword."</p>

<p>"Be it so, and God be with their souls," said
Hagenbach. "But thy ambition must go to sleep
for a while, Scharfgerichter, for the stuff that came
hither to-day is for dungeon and cord, or perhaps
a touch of the rack or strappado&mdash;there is no
honour to win on them."</p>

<p>"The worse luck mine," said the executioner.
"I had dreamed so surely that your honour had
made me noble;&mdash;and then the fall of my sword?"</p>

<p>"Take a bowl of wine, and forget your auguries."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"With your honour's permission, no," said the
executioner; "to drink before noon were to endanger
the nicety of my hand."</p>

<p>"Be silent, then, and mind your duty," said De
Hagenbach.</p>

<p>Francis took up his sheathless sword, wiped the
dust reverently from it, and withdrew into a corner
of the chamber, where he stood leaning with
his hands on the pommel of the fatal weapon.</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards, Kilian entered
at the head of five or six soldiers, conducting the
two Philipsons, whose arms were tied down with
cords.</p>

<p>"Approach me a chair," said the Governor, and
took his place gravely beside a table, on which
stood writing-materials. "Who are these men,
Kilian, and wherefore are they bound?"</p>

<p>"So please your excellency," said Kilian, with
a deep respect of manner, which entirely differed
from the tone, approaching to familiarity, with
which he communicated with his master in private,
"we thought it well that these two strangers
should not appear armed in your gracious presence;
and when we required of them to surrender their
weapons at the gate, as is the custom of the garrison,
this young gallant must needs offer resistance.
I admit he gave up his weapon at his
father's command."</p>

<p>"It is false!" exclaimed young Philipson; but
his father making a sign to him to be silent, he
obeyed instantly.</p>

<p>"Noble sir," said the elder Philipson, "we are
strangers, and unacquainted with the rules of this
citadel; we are Englishmen, and unaccustomed to
submit to personal mishandling; we trust you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
will have excuse for us, when we found ourselves,
without any explanation of the cause, rudely seized
on by we knew not whom. My son, who is young
and unthinking, did partly draw his weapon, but
desisted at my command, without having altogether
unsheathed his sword, far less made a blow.
For myself, I am a merchant, accustomed to submit
to the laws and customs of the countries in
which I traffic; I am in the territories of the Duke
of Burgundy, and I know his laws and customs
must be just and equitable. He is the powerful
and faithful ally of England, and I fear nothing
while under his banner."</p>

<p>"Hem! hem!" replied De Hagenbach, a little
disconcerted by the Englishman's composure, and
perhaps recollecting, that, unless his passions were
awakened (as in the case of the Swiss, whom he
detested), Charles of Burgundy deserved the character
of a just though severe prince,&mdash;"Fair words
are well, but hardly make amends for foul actions.
You have drawn swords in riot, and opposition to
the Duke's soldiers, when obeying the mandates
which regulate their watch."</p>

<p>"Surely, sir," answered Philipson, "this is a
severe construction of a most natural action. But,
in a word, if you are disposed to be rigorous, the
simple action of drawing, or attempting to draw
a sword, in a garrison town, is only punishable by
pecuniary fine, and such we must pay, if it be
your will."</p>

<p>"Now, here is a silly sheep," said Kilian to the
executioner, beside whom he had stationed himself,
somewhat apart from the group, "who voluntarily
offers his own fleece to the clipper."</p>

<p>"It will scarcely serve as a ransom for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
throat, Sir Squire," answered Francis Steinernherz;
"for, look you, I dreamed last night that our master
made me noble, and I knew by the fall of my
sword that this is the man by whom I am to
mount to gentility. I must this very day deal on
him with my good sword."</p>

<p>"Why, thou ambitious fool," said the esquire,
"this is no noble, but an island pedlar&mdash;a mere
English citizen."</p>

<p>"Thou art deceived," said the executioner, "and
hast never looked on men when they are about to
die."</p>

<p>"Have I not?" said the squire. "Have I not
looked on five pitched fields, besides skirmishes
and ambuscades innumerable?"</p>

<p>"That tries not the courage," said the Scharfgerichter.
"All men will fight when pitched
against each other. So will the most paltry curs&mdash;so
will the dunghill fowls. But he is brave
and noble who can look on a scaffold and a block,
a priest to give him absolution, and the headsman
and good sword which is to mow him down in his
strength, as he would look upon things indifferent;
and such a man is that whom we now behold."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Kilian, "but that man looks
not on such an apparatus&mdash;he only sees our illustrious
patron, Sir Archibald de Hagenbach."</p>

<p>"And he who looks upon Sir Archibald," said
the executioner, "being, as yonder man assuredly
is, a person of sense and apprehension, looks he
not upon sword and headsman? Assuredly that
prisoner apprehends as much, and being so composed
as he is under such conviction, it shows him
to be a nobleman by blood, or may I myself never
win nobility!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>"Our master will come to compromise with him,
I judge," replied Kilian; "he looks smilingly on
him."</p>

<p>"Never trust to me, then," said the man in
scarlet; "there is a glance in Sir Archibald's eye
which betokens blood, as surely as the dog-star
bodes pestilence."</p>

<p>While these dependants of Sir Archibald de
Hagenbach were thus conversing apart, their master
had engaged the prisoners in a long train of
captious interrogatories concerning their business
in Switzerland, their connection with the Landamman,
and the cause of their travelling into
Burgundy, to all which the senior Philipson gave
direct and plain answers, excepting to the last.
He was going, he said, into Burgundy, for the
purpose of his traffic&mdash;his wares were at the
disposal of the Governor, who might detain all, or
any part of them, as he might be disposed to make
himself answerable to his master. But his business
with the Duke was of a private nature, respecting
some particular matters of commerce, in
which others as well as he himself were interested.
To the Duke alone, he declared, would he communicate
the affair; and he pressed it strongly
on the Governor, that if he should sustain any
damage in his own person or that of his son, the
Duke's severe displeasure would be the inevitable
consequence.</p>

<p>De Hagenbach was evidently much embarrassed
by the steady tone of his prisoner, and more than
once held counsel with the bottle, his never-failing
oracle in cases of extreme difficulty. Philipson
had readily surrendered to the Governor a list or
invoice of his merchandise, which was of so inviting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
a character that Sir Archibald absolutely
gloated over it. After remaining in deep meditation
for some time, he raised his head and spoke
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must be well aware, Sir Merchant, that
it is the Duke's pleasure that no Swiss merchandise
shall pass through his territories; and that,
nevertheless, you having been, by your own account,
some time in that country, and having also
accompanied a body of men calling themselves
Swiss Deputies, I am authorised to believe that
these valuable articles are rather the property of
those persons, than of a single individual of so
poor an appearance as yourself, and that, should
I demand pecuniary satisfaction, three hundred
pieces of gold would not be an extravagant fine
for so bold a practice; and you might wander
where you will with the rest of your wares, so you
bring them not into Burgundy."</p>

<p>"But it is to Burgundy, and to the Duke's presence,
that I am expressly bound," said the Englishman.
"If I go not thither my journey is
wrecked, and the Duke's displeasure is certain to
light on those who may molest me. For I make
your excellency aware, that your gracious Prince
already knows of my journey, and will make
strict inquiry where and by whom I have been
intercepted."</p>

<p>Again the Governor was silent, endeavouring to
decide how he might best reconcile the gratification
of his rapacity with precaution for his safety.
After a few minutes' consideration he again
addressed his prisoner.</p>

<p>"Thou art very positive in thy tale, my good
friend; but my orders are equally so to exclude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
merchandise coming from Switzerland. What if
I put thy mule and baggage under arrest?"</p>

<p>"I cannot withstand your power, my lord, to do
what you will. I will in that case go to the
Duke's footstool, and do my errand there."</p>

<p>"Ay, and my errand also," answered the Governor.
"That is, thou wilt carry thy complaint to
the Duke against the Governor of La Ferette, for
executing his orders too strictly?"</p>

<p>"On my life and honest word," answered the
Englishman, "I will make no complaint. Leave
me but my ready money, without which I can
hardly travel to the Duke's court, and I will look
no more after these goods and wares than the stag
looks after the antlers which he shed last year."</p>

<p>Again the Governor of La Ferette looked doubtful,
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Men in such a case as yours," he said, "cannot
be trusted, nor, to say truth, is it reasonable
to expect they should be trustworthy. These
same wares, designed for the Duke's private hand,
in what do they consist?"</p>

<p>"They are under seal," replied the Englishman.</p>

<p>"They are of rare value, doubtless?" continued
the Governor.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," answered the elder Philipson;
"I know the Duke sets great store by them. But
your excellency knows, that great princes sometimes
place a high value on trifles."</p>

<p>"Bear you them about you?" said the Governor.
"Take heed how you answer&mdash;Look around you
on these engines, which can bring a dumb man to
speak, and consider I have the power to employ
them!"</p>

<p>"And I the courage to support their worst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
infliction," answered Philipson, with the same
impenetrable coolness which he had maintained
throughout the whole conference.</p>

<p>"Remember, also," said Hagenbach, "that I
can have your person searched as thoroughly as
your mails and budgets."</p>

<p>"I do remember that I am wholly in thy power;
and that I may leave thee no excuse for employing
force on a peaceful traveller, I will own to you,"
said Philipson, "that I have the Duke's packet in
the bosom of my doublet."</p>

<p>"Bring it forth," answered the Governor.</p>

<p>"My hands are tied, both in honour and literally,"
said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Pluck it from his bosom, Kilian," said Sir
Archibald; "let us see this gear he talks of."</p>

<p>"Could resistance avail," replied the stout
merchant, "you should pluck forth my heart first.
But I pray all who are present to observe that the
seals are every one whole and unbroken at this
moment when it is forcibly taken from my
person."</p>

<p>As he spoke thus he looked around on the
soldiers, whose presence De Hagenbach had perhaps
forgotten.</p>

<p>"How, dog!" said Sir Archibald, giving way
to his passion, "would you stir up mutiny among
my men-at-arms?&mdash;Kilian, let the soldiers wait
without."</p>

<p>So saying, he hastily placed under cover of his
own robe the small but remarkably well-secured
packet which Kilian had taken from the merchant's
person. The soldiers withdrew, lingering,
however, and looking back, like children brought
away from a show before its final conclusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"So, fellow!" again began De Hagenbach, "we
are now more private. Wilt thou deal more on
the level with me, and tell me what this packet
is, and whence it comes?"</p>

<p>"Could all your garrison be crowded into this
room, I can only answer as before.&mdash;The contents
I do not precisely know&mdash;the person by whom it
was sent I am determined not to name."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your son," said the Governor, "may be
more compliant."</p>

<p>"He cannot tell you that of which he is himself
ignorant," answered the merchant.</p>

<p>"Perchance the rack may make you both find
your tongues;&mdash;and we will try it on the young
fellow first, Kilian, since thou knowest we have
seen men shrink from beholding the wrenched
joints of their children, that would have committed
their own old sinews to the stretching with
much endurance."</p>

<p>"You may make the trial," said Arthur, "and
Heaven will give me strength to endure"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And me courage to behold," added his father.</p>

<p>All this while the Governor was turning and
re-turning the little packet in his hand, curiously
inspecting every fold, and regretting, doubtless, in
secret, that a few patches of wax, placed under an
envelope of crimson satin, and ligatures of twisted
silk cord, should prevent his eager eyes from ascertaining
the nature of the treasure which he
doubted not it concealed. At length he again
called in the soldiers, and delivered up the two
prisoners to their charge, commanding that they
should be kept safely, and in separate holds, and
that the father, in particular, should be most carefully
looked after.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>"I take you all here to witness," exclaimed the
elder Philipson, despising the menacing signs of
De Hagenbach, "that the Governor detains from
me a packet, addressed to his most gracious lord
and master, the Duke of Burgundy."</p>

<p>De Hagenbach actually foamed at the mouth
with passion.</p>

<p>"And should I <i>not</i> detain it?" he exclaimed,
in a voice inarticulate with rage. "May there not
be some foul practice against the life of our most
gracious sovereign, by poison or otherwise, in this
suspicious packet, brought by a most suspicious
bearer? Have we never heard of poisons which
do their work by the smell? And shall we, who
keep the gate, as I may say, of his Grace of Burgundy's
dominions, give access to what may rob
Europe of its pride of chivalry, Burgundy of its
prince, and Flanders of her father?&mdash;No! Away
with these miscreants, soldiers&mdash;down to the lowest
dungeons with them&mdash;keep them separate, and
watch them carefully. This treasonable practice
has been meditated with the connivance of Berne
and Soleure."</p>

<p>Thus Sir Archibald de Hagenbach raved, with
a raised voice and inflamed countenance, lashing
himself as it were into passion, until the steps of
the soldiers, and the clash of their arms, as they
retired with the prisoners, were no longer audible.
His complexion, when these had ceased, waxed
paler than was natural to him&mdash;his brow was
furrowed with anxious wrinkles&mdash;and his voice
became lower and more hesitating than ordinary,
as, turning to his esquire, he said, "Kilian, we
stand upon a slippery plank, with a raging torrent
beneath us&mdash;What is to be done?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i303" id="i303"></a>

<p>"Marry, to move forward with a resolved yet
prudent step," answered the crafty Kilian. "It
is unlucky that all these fellows should have seen
the packet, and heard the appeal of yonder iron-nerved
trader. But this ill luck has befallen us,
and the packet having been in your excellency's
hands, you will have all the credit of having
broken the seals; for, though you leave them as
entire as the moment they were impressed, it will
only be supposed they have been ingeniously replaced.
Let us see what are the contents, before
we determine what is to be done with them. They
must be of rare value, since the churl merchant
was well contented to leave behind all his rich
mule's-load of merchandise, so that this precious
packet might pass unexamined."</p>

<p>"They may be papers on some political matter.
Many such, and of high importance, pass secretly
between Edward of England and our bold Duke."
Such was the reply of De Hagenbach.</p>

<p>"If they be papers of consequence to the Duke,"
answered Kilian, "we can forward them to Dijon.&mdash;Or
they may be such as Louis of France would
purchase with their weight of gold."</p>

<p>"For shame, Kilian!" said the Knight.
"Wouldst thou have me betray my master's secrets
to the King of France? Sooner would I lay
my head on the block."</p>

<p>"Indeed? And yet your excellency hesitates
not to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here the squire stopped, apparently for fear of
giving offence, by affixing a name too broad and
intelligible to the practices of his patron.</p>

<p>"To plunder the Duke, thou wouldst say, thou
impudent slave? And, saying so, thou wouldst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
be as dull as thou art wont to be," answered De
Hagenbach. "I partake, indeed, in the plunder
which the Duke takes from aliens; and reason good.
Even so the hound and the hawk have their share
of the quarry they bring down&mdash;ay, and the lion's
share too, unless the huntsman or falconer be all
the nearer to them. Such are the perquisites of
my rank; and the Duke, who placed me here for
the gratification of his resentment, and the bettering
of my fortune, does not grudge them to a
faithful servant. And, indeed, I may term myself,
in so far as this territory of La Ferette
extends, the Duke's full representative, or, as it
may be termed, <span class="smcap">Alter Ego</span>&mdash;and, thereupon, I
will open this packet, which, being addressed to
him, is thereby equally addressed to me."</p>

<p>Having thus in a manner talked himself up to
an idea of his own high authority, he cut the
strings of the packet which he had all this while
held in his hand, and, undoing the outer coverings,
produced a very small case made of sandalwood.</p>

<p>"The contents," he said, "had need to be valuable,
as they lie in so little compass."</p>

<p>So saying he pressed the spring, and the casket,
opening, displayed a necklace of diamonds, distinguished
by brilliancy and size, and apparently of
extraordinary value. The eyes of the avaricious
Governor, and his no less rapacious attendant,
were so dazzled with the unusual splendour, that
for some time they could express nothing save joy
and surprise.</p>

<p>"Ay, marry, sir," said Kilian, "the obstinate
old knave had reasons for his hardihood. My
own joints should have stood a strain or two ere I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
surrendered such sparklers as these.&mdash;And now,
Sir Archibald, may your trusty follower ask you
how this booty is to be divided between the Duke
and his Governor, according to the most approved
rules of garrison towns?"</p>

<p>"Faith, we will suppose the garrison stormed,
Kilian; and in a storm, thou know'st, the first
finder takes all&mdash;with due consideration always
of his trusty followers."</p>

<p>"As myself, for example," said Kilian.</p>

<p>"Ay, and myself, for example," answered a
voice, which sounded like the echo of the esquire's
words, from the remote corner of the ancient
apartment.</p>

<p>"'Sdeath! we are overheard," exclaimed the
Governor, starting and laying his hand on his
dagger.</p>

<p>"Only by a faithful follower, as the worthy
esquire observes," said the executioner, moving
slowly forward.</p>

<p>"Villain, how didst thou dare watch me?"
said Sir Archibald de Hagenbach.</p>

<p>"Trouble not yourself for that, sir," said Kilian.
"Honest Steinernherz has no tongue to speak, or
ear to hear, save according to your pleasure. Indeed,
we must shortly have taken him into our
counsels, seeing these men must be dealt upon,
and that speedily."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said De Hagenbach; "I had thought
they might be spared."</p>

<p>"To tell the Duke of Burgundy how the Governor
of La Ferette accounts to his treasurer for the
duties and forfeitures at his custom-house?" demanded
Kilian.</p>

<p>"'Tis true," said the Knight; "dead men have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
neither teeth nor tongue&mdash;they bite not, and they
tell no tales. Thou wilt take order with them,
Scharfgerichter."</p>

<p>"I will, my lord," answered the executioner,
"on condition that, if this must be in the way of
dungeon execution, which I call cellar practice,
my privilege to claim nobility shall be saved and
reserved to me, and the execution shall be declared
to be as effectual to my claim, as it might have
been if the blow had been dealt in broad daylight,
with my honourable blade of office."</p>

<p>De Hagenbach stared at the executioner, as not
understanding what he meant; on which Kilian
took occasion to explain, that the Scharfgerichter
was strongly impressed, from the free and dauntless
conduct of the elder prisoner, that he was a
man of noble blood, from whose decapitation he
would himself derive all the advantages proposed
to the headsman who should execute his function
on nine men of illustrious extraction.</p>

<p>"He may be right," said Sir Archibald, "for
here is a slip of parchment, commending the bearer
of this carcanet to the Duke, desiring him to
accept it as a true token from one well known to
him, and to give the bearer full credence in all
that he should say on the part of those by whom
he is sent."</p>

<p>"By whom is the note signed, if I may make
bold to ask?" said Kilian.</p>

<p>"There is no name&mdash;the Duke must be supposed
to collect that information from the gems, or
perhaps the handwriting."</p>

<p>"On neither of which he is likely to have a
speedy opportunity of exercising his ingenuity,"
said Kilian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>De Hagenbach looked at the diamonds, and
smiled darkly. The Scharfgerichter, encouraged
by the familiarity into which he had in a manner
forced himself, returned to his plea, and insisted
on the nobility of the supposed merchant. Such
a trust, and such a letter of unlimited credence,
could never, he contended, be intrusted to a man
meanly born.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"Thou art deceived, thou fool," said the Knight;
"kings now use the lowest tools to do their dearest
offices. Louis has set the example of putting his
barber, and the valets of his chamber, to do the
work formerly intrusted to dukes and peers; and
other monarchs begin to think that it is better, in
choosing their agents for important affairs, to judge
rather by the quality of men's brains than that of
their blood. And as for the stately look and bold
bearing which distinguish yonder fellow in the
eyes of cravens like thee, it belongs to his country,
not his rank. Thou think'st it is in England
as in Flanders, where a city-bred burgher of Ghent,
Liège, or Ypres is as distinct an animal from a
knight of Hainault as a Flanders wagon horse from
a Spanish jennet. But thou art deceived. England
has many a merchant as haughty of heart,
and as prompt of hand, as any noble-born son of
her rich bosom. But be not dejected, thou foolish
man; do thy business well on this merchant, and
we shall presently have on our hands the Landamman
of Unterwalden, who, though a churl by his
choice, is yet a nobleman by blood, and shall, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
his well-deserved death, aid thee to get rid of the
peasant slough which thou art so weary of."</p>

<p>"Were not your excellency better adjourn these
men's fate," said Kilian, "till you hear something
of them from the Swiss prisoners whom we shall
presently have in our power?"</p>

<p>"Be it as you will," said Hagenbach, waving
his hand, as if putting aside some disagreeable
task. "But let all be finished ere I hear of it
again."</p>

<p>The stern satellites bowed obedience, and the
deadly conclave broke up; their chief carefully
securing the valuable gems, which he was willing
to purchase at the expense of treachery to the
sovereign in whose employment he had enlisted
himself, as well as the blood of two innocent men.
Yet, with a weakness of mind not uncommon to
great criminals, he shrank from the thoughts of
his own baseness and cruelty, and endeavoured to
banish the feeling of dishonour from his mind, by
devolving the immediate execution of his villany
upon his subordinate agents.

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>And this place our forefathers built for man!</p>

<p class="i16"><i>Old Play.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The dungeon in which the younger Philipson was
immured was one of those gloomy caverns which
cry shame on the inhumanity of our ancestors.
They seem to have been almost insensible to the
distinction betwixt innocence and guilt, as the
consequences of mere accusation must have been
far more severe in those days than is in our own
that species of imprisonment which is adjudged
as an express punishment for crime.</p>

<p>The cell of Arthur Philipson was of considerable
length, but dark and narrow, and dug out of the
solid rock upon which the tower was founded.
A small lamp was allowed him, not, however,
without some grumbling, but his arms were still
kept bound; and when he asked for a draught of
water, one of the grim satellites by whom he was
thrust into this cell answered surlily that he might
endure his thirst for all the time his life was
likely to last&mdash;a gloomy response, which augured
that his privations would continue as long as his
life, yet neither be of long duration. By the dim
lamp he had groped his way to a bench, or rough
seat, cut in the rock; and, as his eyes got gradually
accustomed to the obscurity of the region
in which he was immured, he became aware of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
ghastly cleft in the floor of his dungeon, somewhat
resembling the opening of a draw-well, but irregular
in its aperture, and apparently the mouth of a
gulf of Nature's conformation, slightly assisted by
the labour of human art.</p>

<p>"Here, then, is my death-bed," he said, "and
that gulf perhaps the grave which yawns for my
remains! Nay, I have heard of prisoners being
plunged into such horrid abysses while they were
yet alive, to die at leisure, crushed with wounds,
their groans unheard, and their fate unpitied!"</p>

<p>He approached his head to the dismal cavity,
and heard, as at a great depth, the sound of a
sullen and, as it seemed, subterranean stream.
The sunless waves appeared murmuring for their
victim. Death is dreadful at all ages; but in the
first springtide of youth, with all the feelings of
enjoyment afloat, and eager for gratification, to be
snatched forcibly from the banquet to which the
individual has but just sat down, is peculiarly
appalling, even when the change comes in the
ordinary course of nature. But to sit, like young
Philipson, on the brink of the subterranean abyss,
and ruminate in horrid doubt concerning the mode
in which death was to be inflicted, was a situation
which might break the spirit of the boldest; and
the unfortunate captive was wholly unable to suppress
the natural tears that flowed from his eyes in
torrents, and which his bound arms did not permit
him to wipe away. We have already noticed that,
although a gallant young man in aught of danger
which was to be faced and overcome by active
exertion, the youth was strongly imaginative, and
sensitive to a powerful extent to all those exaggerations
which, in a situation of helpless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
uncertainty, fancy lends to distract the soul of him
who must passively expect an approaching evil.</p>

<p>Yet the feelings of Arthur Philipson were not
selfish. They reverted to his father, whose just
and noble character was as much formed to attract
veneration, as his unceasing paternal care and
affection to excite love and gratitude. He too was
in the hands of remorseless villains, who were
determined to conceal robbery by secret murder&mdash;he
too, undaunted in so many dangers, resolute in
so many encounters, lay bound and defenceless,
exposed to the dagger of the meanest stabber.
Arthur remembered, too, the giddy peak of the
rock near Geierstein, and the grim vulture which
claimed him as its prey. Here was no angel to
burst through the mist, and marshal him on a
path of safety&mdash;here the darkness was subterranean
and eternal, saving when the captive should
behold the knife of the ruffian flash against the
lamp which lent him light to aim the fatal blow.
This agony of mind lasted until the feelings of the
unhappy prisoner arose to ecstasy. He started up,
and struggled so hard to free himself of his bonds,
that it seemed they should have fallen from him
as from the arms of the mighty Nazarene. But
the cords were of too firm a texture; and after a
violent and unavailing struggle, in which the
ligatures seemed to enter his flesh, the prisoner
lost his balance, and, while the feeling thrilled
through him that he was tumbling backward into
the subterranean abyss, he fell to the ground with
great force.</p>

<p>Fortunately he escaped the danger which in his
agony he apprehended, but so narrowly, that his
head struck against the low and broken fence with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
which the mouth of the horrible pit was partly
surrounded. Here he lay stunned and motionless,
and, as the lamp was extinguished in his fall,
immersed in absolute and total darkness. He was
recalled to sensation by a jarring noise.</p>

<p>"They come&mdash;they come&mdash;the murderers! Oh,
Lady of Mercy! and oh, gracious Heaven, forgive
my transgressions!"</p>

<p>He looked up, and observed, with dazzled eyes,
that a dark form approached him, with a knife in
one hand and a torch in the other. He might
well have seemed the man who was to do the last
deed upon the unhappy prisoner, if he had come
alone. But he came not alone&mdash;his torch gleamed
upon the white dress of a female, which was so
much illuminated by it that Arthur could discover
a form, and had even a glimpse of features,
never to be forgotten, though now seen under circumstances
least of all to be expected. The prisoner's
unutterable astonishment impressed him
with a degree of awe which overcame even his
personal fear&mdash;"Can these things be?" was his
muttered reflection. "Has she really the power of
an elementary spirit? Has she conjured up this
earthlike and dark demon to concur with her in
my deliverance?"</p>

<p>It appeared as if his guess were real; for the
figure in black, giving the light to Anne of Geierstein,
or at least the form which bore her perfect
resemblance, stooped over the prisoner, and cut the
cord that bound his arms, with so much despatch
that it seemed as if it fell from his person at a
touch. Arthur's first attempt to arise was unsuccessful,
and a second time it was the hand of Anne
of Geierstein&mdash;a living hand, sensible to touch as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
to sight&mdash;which aided to raise and to support him,
as it had formerly done when the tormented waters
of the river thundered at their feet. Her touch
produced an effect far beyond that of the slight
personal aid which the maiden's strength could
have rendered. Courage was restored to his heart,
vigour and animation to his benumbed and bruised
limbs; such influence does the human mind, when
excited to energy, possess over the infirmities of
the human body. He was about to address Anne
in accents of the deepest gratitude. But the
accents died away on his tongue, when the mysterious
female, laying her finger on her lips, made
him a sign to be silent, and at the same time
beckoned him to follow her. He obeyed in silent
amazement. They passed the entrance of the
melancholy dungeon, and through one or two short
but intricate passages, which, cut out of the rock
in some places, and built in others with hewn
stone of the same kind, probably led to holds
similar to that in which Arthur was so lately a
captive.</p>

<p>The recollection that his father might be immured
in some such horrid cell as he himself had
just quitted, induced Arthur to pause as they
reached the bottom of a small winding staircase,
which conducted apparently from this region of
the building.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "dearest Anne, lead me to his
deliverance! I must not leave my father."</p>

<p>She shook her head impatiently, and beckoned
him on.</p>

<p>"If your power extends not to save my father's
life, I will remain and save him or die!&mdash;Anne,
dearest Anne"&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>She answered not, but her companion replied,
in a deep voice, not unsuitable to his appearance,
"Speak, young man, to those who are permitted to
answer you; or rather, be silent, and listen to my
instructions, which direct to the only course which
can bring thy father to freedom and safety."</p>

<p>They ascended the stair, Anne of Geierstein
going first; while Arthur, who followed close
behind, could not help thinking that her form
gave existence to a part of the light which her
garment reflected from the torch. This was probably
the effect of the superstitious belief impressed
on his mind by Rudolph's tale respecting
her mother, and which was confirmed by her sudden
appearance in a place and situation where she
was so little to have been expected. He had not
much time, however, to speculate upon her appearance
or demeanour, for, mounting the stair with a
lighter pace than he was able at the time to follow
closely, she was no longer to be seen when he
reached the landing-place. But whether she had
melted into the air, or turned aside into some
other passage, he was not permitted a moment's
leisure to examine.</p>

<p>"Here lies your way," said his sable guide; and
at the same time dashing out the light, and seizing
Philipson by the arm, he led him along a dark
gallery of considerable length. The young man
was not without some momentary misgivings,
while he recollected the ominous looks of his
conductor, and that he was armed with a dagger,
or knife, which he could plunge of a sudden into
his bosom. But he could not bring himself to
dread treachery from any one whom he had seen
in company with Anne of Geierstein; and in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
heart he demanded her pardon for the fear which
had flashed across him, and resigned himself to
the guidance of his companion, who advanced with
hasty but light footsteps, and cautioned him by a
whisper to do the same.</p>

<p>"Our journey," he at length said, "ends here."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a door gave way, and admitted
them into a gloomy Gothic apartment, furnished
with large oaken presses, apparently filled with
books and manuscripts. As Arthur looked round,
with eyes dazzled with the sudden gleam of daylight
from which he had been for some time
excluded, the door by which they had entered disappeared.
This, however, did not greatly surprise
him, who judged that, being formed in appearance
to correspond with the presses around the entrance
which they had used, it could not when shut be
distinguished from them; a device sometimes then
practised, as indeed it often is at the present day.
He had now a full view of his deliverer, who,
when seen by daylight, showed only the vestments
and features of a clergyman, without any
of that expression of supernatural horror which
the partial light and the melancholy appearance
of all in the dungeon had combined to impress on
him.</p>

<p>Young Philipson once more breathed with freedom,
as one awakened from a hideous dream; and
the supernatural qualities with which his imagination
had invested Anne of Geierstein having
begun to vanish, he addressed his deliverer thus:
"That I may testify my thanks, holy father, where
they are so especially due, let me inquire of you if
Anne of Geierstein"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speak of that which pertains to your house and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
family," answered the priest, as briefly as before.
"Hast thou so soon forgot thy father's danger?"</p>

<p>"By heavens, no!" replied the youth. "Tell
me but how to act for his deliverance, and thou
shalt see how a son can fight for a parent!"</p>

<p>"It is well, for it is needful," said the priest.
"Don thou this vestment, and follow me."</p>

<p>The vestment presented was the gown and hood
of a novice.</p>

<p>"Draw the cowl over thy face," said the priest,
"and return no answer to any man who meets
thee. I will say thou art under a vow.&mdash;May
Heaven forgive the unworthy tyrant who imposes
on us the necessity of such profane dissimulation!
Follow me close and near&mdash;beware that you speak
not."</p>

<p>The business of disguise was soon accomplished,
and the Priest of St. Paul's, for such he was,
moving on, Arthur followed him a pace or two
behind, assuming as well as he could the modest
step and humble demeanour of a spiritual novice.
On leaving the library, or study, and descending
a short stair, he found himself in the street of
Brisach. Irresistibly tempted to look back, he
had only time, however, to see that the house he
had left was a very small building of a Gothic
character, on the one side of which rose the
church of St. Paul's, and on the other the stern
black gate-house, or entrance-tower.</p>

<p>"Follow me, Melchior," said the deep voice of
the priest; and his keen eyes were at the same
time fixed upon the supposed novice, with a look
which instantly recalled Arthur to a sense of his
situation.</p>

<p>They passed along, nobody noticing them, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
to greet the priest with a silent obeisance, or muttered
phrase of salutation, until, having nearly
gained the middle of the village, the guide turned
abruptly off from the street, and, moving northward
by a short lane, reached a flight of steps, which, as
usual in fortified towns, led to the banquette, or
walk behind the parapet, which was of the old
Gothic fashion, flanked with towers from space to
space, of different forms and various heights at
different angles.</p>

<p>There were sentinels on the walls; but the watch,
as it seemed, was kept not by regular soldiers, but
by burghers, with spears, or swords, in their hands.
The first whom they passed said to the priest,
in a half-whispered tone, "Holds our purpose?"</p>

<p>"It holds," replied the Priest of St. Paul's.&mdash;"Benedicite!"</p>

<p>"<i>Deo Gratias!</i>" replied the armed citizen, and
continued his walk upon the battlements.</p>

<p>The other sentinels seemed to avoid them; for
they disappeared when they came near, or passed
them without looking, or seeming to observe them.
At last their walk brought them to an ancient
turret, which raised its head above the wall, and
in which there was a small door opening from the
battlement. It was in a corner, distinct from and
uncommanded by any of the angles of the fortification.
In a well-guarded fortress, such a point
ought to have had a sentinel for its special protection,
but no one was there upon duty.</p>

<p>"Now mark me," said the priest, "for your
father's life, and, it may be, that of many a man
besides, depends upon your attention, and no less
upon your despatch.&mdash;You can run?&mdash;you can
leap?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel no weariness, father, since you freed me,"
answered Arthur; "and the dun deer that I have
often chased shall not beat me in such a wager."</p>

<p>"Observe then," replied the Black Priest of St.
Paul's, "this turret contains a staircase, which
descends to a small sallyport. I will give you
entrance to it&mdash;The sallyport is barred on the
inside, but not locked. It will give you access
to the moat, which is almost entirely dry. On
crossing it, you will find yourself in the circuit of
the outer barriers. You may see sentinels, but
they will not see you&mdash;speak not to them, but
make your way over the palisade as you can. I
trust you can climb over an undefended rampart?"</p>

<p>"I have surmounted a defended one," said
Arthur. "What is my next charge?&mdash;All this is
easy."</p>

<p>"You will see a species of thicket, or stretch of
low bushes&mdash;make for it with all speed. When
you are there, turn to the eastward; but beware,
while holding that course, that you are not seen
by the Burgundian Free Companions, who are on
watch on that part of the walls. A volley of
arrows, and the sally of a body of cavalry in pursuit,
will be the consequence, if they get sight of
you; and their eyes are those of the eagle, that spy
the carnage afar off."</p>

<p>"I will be heedful," said the young Englishman.</p>

<p>"You will find," continued the priest, "upon
the outer side of the thicket a path, or rather a
sheep-track, which, sweeping at some distance
from the walls, will conduct you at last into the
road leading from Brisach to Bâle. Hasten forward
to meet the Swiss, who are advancing. Tell
them your father's hours are counted, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
they must press on if they would save him; and
say to Rudolph Donnerhugel, in especial, that the
Black Priest of St. Paul's waits to bestow upon
him his blessing at the northern sallyport. Dost
thou understand me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," answered the young man.</p>

<p>The Priest of St. Paul's then pushed open the
low-browed gate of the turret, and Arthur was
about to precipitate himself down the stair which
opened before him.</p>

<p>"Stay yet a moment," said the priest, "and doff
the novice's habit, which can only encumber
thee."</p>

<p>Arthur in a trice threw it from him, and was
again about to start.</p>

<p>"Stay yet a moment longer," continued the
Black Priest. "This gown may be a tell-tale&mdash;Stay,
therefore, and help me to pull off my upper
garment."</p>

<p>Inwardly glowing with impatience, Arthur yet
saw the necessity of obeying his guide; and when
he had pulled the long and loose upper vestment
from the old man, he stood before him in a cassock
of black serge, befitting his order and profession,
but begirt, not with a suitable sash such as clergymen
wear, but with a most uncanonical buff-belt,
supporting a short two-edged sword, calculated
alike to stab and to smite.</p>

<p>"Give me now the novice's habit," said the
venerable father, "and over that I will put the
priestly vestment. Since for the present I have
some tokens of the laity about me, it is fitting it
should be covered with a double portion of the
clerical habit."</p>

<p>As he spoke thus he smiled grimly; and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
smile had something more frightful and withering
than the stern frown, which suited better with his
features, and was their usual expression.</p>

<p>"And now," said he, "what does the fool tarry
for, when life and death are in his speed?"</p>

<p>The young messenger waited not a second hint,
but at once descended the stairs, as if it had been
by a single step, found the portal, as the priest
had said, only secured by bars on the inside, offering
little resistance save from their rusted state,
which made it difficult to draw them. Arthur
succeeded, however, and found himself at the side
of the moat, which presented a green and marshy
appearance. Without stopping to examine whether
it was deep or shallow, and almost without being
sensible of the tenacity of the morass, the young
Englishman forced his way through it, and attained
the opposite side, without attracting the attention
of two worthy burghers of Brisach, who were the
guardians of the barriers. One of them indeed
was deeply employed in the perusal of some profane
chronicle, or religious legend; the other was
as anxiously engaged in examining the margin of
the moat, in search of eels, perhaps, or frogs, for
he wore over his shoulder a scrip for securing some
such amphibious booty.</p>

<p>Seeing that, as the priest foretold, he had nothing
to apprehend from the vigilance of the sentinels,
Arthur dashed at the palisade, in hope to catch
hold of the top of the stockade, and so to clear it
by one bold leap. He overrated his powers of
activity, however, or they were diminished by his
recent bonds and imprisonment. He fell lightly
backward on the ground, and, as he got to his feet,
became aware of the presence of a soldier, in yellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
and blue, the livery of De Hagenbach, who came
running towards him, crying to the slothful and
unobservant sentinels, "Alarm!&mdash;alarm!&mdash;you
lazy swine! Stop the dog, or you are both dead
men."</p>

<p>The fisherman, who was on the farther side, laid
down his eel-spear, drew his sword, and, flourishing
it over his head, advanced towards Philipson
with very moderate haste. The student was yet
more unfortunate, for, in his hurry to fold up his
book and attend to his duty, he contrived to
throw himself (inadvertently, doubtless) full in
the soldier's way. The latter, who was running at
top speed, encountered the burgher with a severe
shock which threw both down; but the citizen,
being a solid and substantial man, lay still where
he fell, while the other, less weighty, and probably
less prepared for the collision, lost his
balance and the command of his limbs at once,
and, rolling over the edge of the moat, was immersed
in the mud and marsh. The fisher and the
student went with deliberate speed to assist the
unexpected and unwelcome partner of their watch;
while Arthur, stimulated by the imminent sense
of danger, sprang at the barrier with more address
and vigour than before, and, succeeding in his
leap, made, as he had been directed, with his
utmost speed for the covert of the adjacent bushes.
He reached them without hearing any alarm from
the walls. But he was conscious that his situation
had become extremely precarious, since his
escape from the town was known to one man at
least who would not fail to give the alarm in case
he was able to extricate himself from the marsh&mdash;a
feat, however, in which it seemed to Arthur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
that the armed citizens were likely to prove rather
his apparent than actual assistants. While such
thoughts shot across his mind, they served to augment
his natural speed of foot, so that in less
space than could have been thought possible, he
reached the thinner extremity of the thicket,
whence, as intimated by the Black Priest, he could
see the eastern tower and the adjoining battlements
of the town&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>With hostile faces throng'd, and fiery arms.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It required, at the same time, some address on
the part of the fugitive to keep so much under
shelter as to prevent himself from being seen in
his turn by those whom he saw so plainly. He
therefore expected every moment to hear a bugle
wind, or to behold that bustle and commotion
among the defenders which might prognosticate a
sally. Neither, however, took place, and heedfully
observing the footpath, or track, which the
priest had pointed out to him, young Philipson
wheeled his course out of sight of the guarded
towers, and soon falling into the public and frequented
road, by which his father and he had
approached the town in the morning, he had the
happiness, by the dust and flash of arms, to see
a small body of armed men advancing towards
Brisach, whom he justly concluded to be the van
of the Swiss deputation.</p>

<p>He soon met the party, which consisted of about
ten men, with Rudolph Donnerhugel at their head.
The figure of Philipson, covered with mud, and in
some places stained with blood (for his fall in the
dungeon had cost him a slight wound), attracted
the wonder of every one, who crowded around to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
hear the news. Rudolph alone appeared unmoved.
Like the visage on the ancient statues of Hercules,
the physiognomy of the bulky Bernese was large
and massive, having an air of indifferent and
almost sullen composure, which did not change
but in moments of the fiercest agitation.</p>

<p>He listened without emotion to the breathless
tale of Arthur Philipson, that his father was in
prison, and adjudged to death.</p>

<p>"And what else did you expect?" said the
Bernese, coldly. "Were you not warned? It
had been easy to have foreseen the misfortune, but
it may be impossible to prevent it."</p>

<p>"I own&mdash;I own," said Arthur, wringing his
hands, "that you were wise, and that we were
foolish.&mdash;But oh! do not think of our folly in the
moment of our extremity! Be the gallant and
generous champion which your Cantons proclaim
you&mdash;give us your aid in this deadly strait!"</p>

<p>"But how, or in what manner?" said Rudolph,
still hesitating. "We have dismissed the Bâlese,
who were willing to have given assistance, so
much did your dutiful example weigh with us.
We are now scarce above a score of men&mdash;how
can you ask us to attack a garrison town, secured
by fortifications, and where there are six times our
number?"</p>

<p>"You have friends within the fortifications,"
replied Arthur&mdash;"I am sure you have. Hark in
your ear&mdash;The Black Priest sent to you&mdash;to you,
Rudolph Donnerhugel of Berne&mdash;that he waits to
give you his blessing at the northern sallyport."</p>

<p>"Ay, doubtless," said Rudolph, shaking himself
free of Arthur's attempt to engage him in private
conference, and speaking so that all around might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
hear him, "there is little doubt on't; I will find
a priest at the northern sallyport to confess and
absolve me, and a block, axe, and headsman to
strike my throat asunder when he has done. But
I will scarce put the neck of my father's son into
such risk. If they assassinate an English pedlar,
who has never offended them, what will they do
with the Bear of Berne, whose fangs and talons
Archibald de Hagenbach has felt ere now?"</p>

<p>Young Philipson at these words clasped his
hands together, and held them up to heaven, as
one who abandons hope, excepting thence. The
tears started to his eyes, and, clenching his hands
and setting his teeth, he turned his back abruptly
upon the Swiss.</p>

<p>"What means this passion?" said Rudolph.
"Whither would you now?"</p>

<p>"To rescue my father, or perish with him," said
Arthur; and was about to run wildly back to La
Ferette, when a strong but kindly grasp detained
him.</p>

<p>"Tarry a little till I tie my garter," said Sigismund
Biederman, "and I will go with you, King
Arthur."</p>

<p>"You? oaf!" exclaimed Rudolph. "You?&mdash;and
without orders?"</p>

<p>"Why, look you, cousin Rudolph," said the
youth, continuing, with great composure, to fasten
his garter, which, after the fashion of the time,
was somewhat intricately secured&mdash;"you are
always telling us that we are Swiss and freemen;
and what is the advantage of being a freeman, if
one is not at liberty to do what he has a mind?
You are my Hauptman, look you, so long as it
pleases me, and no longer."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>"And why shouldst thou desert me now, thou
fool? Why at this minute, of all other minutes
in the year?" demanded the Bernese.</p>

<p>"Look you," replied the insubordinate follower,
"I have hunted with Arthur for this month past,
and I love him&mdash;he never called me fool or idiot,
because my thoughts came slower, maybe, and
something duller, than those of other folk. And
I love his father&mdash;the old man gave me this
baldrick and this horn, which I warrant cost many
a kreutzer. He told me, too, not to be discouraged,
for that it was better to think justly than to
think fast, and that I had sense enough for the
one if not for the other. And the kind old man
is now in Hagenbach's butcher-shambles!&mdash;But
we will free him, Arthur, if two men may. Thou
shalt see me fight, while steel blade and ashen
shaft will hold together."</p>

<p>So saying, he shook in the air his enormous
partisan, which quivered in his grasp like a slip
of willow. Indeed, if Iniquity was to be struck
down like an ox, there was not one in that chosen
band more likely to perform the feat than Sigismund;
for though somewhat shorter in stature than
his brethren, and of a less animated spirit, yet
his breadth of shoulders and strength of muscles
were enormous, and if thoroughly aroused and disposed
for the contest, which was very rarely the
case, perhaps Rudolph himself might, as far as sheer
force went, have had difficulty in matching him.</p>

<p>Truth of sentiment and energy of expression
always produce an effect on natural and generous
characters. Several of the youths around began
to exclaim that Sigismund said well; that if the
old man had put himself in danger, it was because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
he thought more of the success of their negotiation
than of his own safety, and had taken himself
from under their protection, rather than involve
them in quarrels on his account. "We are the
more bound," they said, "to see him unscathed;
and we will do so."</p>

<p>"Peace! all you wiseacres," said Rudolph, looking
round with an air of superiority; "and you,
Arthur of England, pass on to the Landamman,
who is close behind. You know he is our chief
commander, he is no less your father's sincere
friend, and, whatever he may determine in your
father's favour, you will find most ready executors
of his pleasure in all of us."</p>

<p>His companions appeared to concur in this
advice, and young Philipson saw that his own
compliance with the recommendation was indispensable.
Indeed, although he still suspected that
the Bernese, by his various intrigues, as well with
the Swiss youth as with those of Bâle, and, as
might be inferred from the Priest of St. Paul's,
by communication even within the town of La
Ferette, possessed the greater power of assisting
him at such a conjuncture; yet he trusted far more
in the simple candour and perfect faith of Arnold
Biederman, and pressed forward to tell to him his
mournful tale, and crave his assistance.</p>

<p>From the top of a bank which he reached in a
few minutes after he parted from Rudolph and the
advanced guard, he saw beneath him the venerable
Landamman and his associates, attended by a few
of the youths, who no longer were dispersed upon
the flanks of the party, but attended on them
closely, and in military array, as men prepared to
repel any sudden attack.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>Behind came a mule or two with baggage,
together with the animals which, in the ordinary
course of their march, supported Anne of Geierstein
and her attendant. Both were occupied by female
figures as usual, and, to the best of Arthur's ken,
the foremost had the well-known dress of Anne,
from the grey mantle to a small heron's plume,
which, since entering Germany, she had worn in
compliance with the custom of the country, and in
evidence of her rank as a maiden of birth and distinction.
Yet, if the youth's eyes brought him
true tidings at present, what was the character of
their former information, when, scarce more than
half an hour since, they had beheld, in the subterranean
dungeon of Brisach, the same form which
they now rested upon, in circumstances so very
different! The feeling excited by this thought
was powerful, but it was momentary, like the
lightning which blazes through a midnight sky,
which is but just seen ere it vanishes into darkness.
Or, rather, the wonder excited by this marvellous
incident only maintained its ground in his
thoughts by allying itself with the anxiety for
his father's safety, which was their predominant
occupation.</p>

<p>"If there be indeed a spirit," he said, "which
wears that beautiful form, it must be beneficent
as well as lovely, and will extend to my far more
deserving father the protection which his son has
twice experienced."</p>

<p>But ere he had time to prosecute such a thought
further, he had met the Landamman and his party.
Here his appearance and his condition excited
the same surprise as they had formerly occasioned
to Rudolph and the vanguard. To the repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
interrogatories of the Landamman he gave a brief
account of his own imprisonment, and of his
escape, of which he suffered the whole glory to
rest with the Black Priest of St. Paul's, without
mentioning one word of the more interesting female
apparition, by which he had been attended and
assisted in his charitable task. On another point
also Arthur was silent. He saw no propriety in
communicating to Arnold Biederman the message
which the priest had addressed to Rudolph's ear
alone. Whether good should come of it or no, he
held sacred the obligation of silence imposed upon
him by a man from whom he had just received the
most important assistance.</p>

<p>The Landamman was struck dumb for a moment
with sorrow and surprise at the news which he
heard. The elder Philipson had gained his respect,
as well by the purity and steadiness of the
principles which he expressed, as by the extent
and depth of his information, which was peculiarly
valuable and interesting to the Switzer, who felt
his admirable judgment considerably fettered for
want of that knowledge of countries, times, and
manners, with which his English friend often
supplied him.</p>

<p>"Let us press forward," he said to the Banneret
of Berne and the other deputies; "let us offer our
mediation betwixt the tyrant De Hagenbach and
our friend, whose life is in danger. He must
listen to us, for I know his master expects to see
this Philipson at his court. The old man hinted
to me so much. As we are possessed of such a
secret, Archibald de Hagenbach will not dare to
brave our vengeance, since we might easily send
to Duke Charles information how the Governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
La Ferette abuses his power, in matters where not
only the Swiss but where the Duke himself is
concerned."</p>

<p>"Under your reverend favour, my worthy sir,"
answered the Banneret of Berne, "we are Swiss
Deputies, and go to represent the injuries of
Switzerland alone. If we embroil ourselves with
the quarrels of strangers, we shall find it more
difficult to settle advantageously those of our own
country; and if the Duke should, by this villany
done upon English merchants, bring upon him the
resentment of the English monarch, such breach
will only render it more a matter of peremptory
necessity for him to make a treaty advantageous
to the Swiss Cantons."</p>

<p>There was so much worldly policy in this advice,
that Adam Zimmerman of Soleure instantly expressed
his assent, with the additional argument,
that their brother Biederman had told them scarce
two hours before how these English merchants
had, by his advice and their own free desire,
parted company with them that morning, on purpose
that they might not involve the Deputies in
the quarrels which might be raised by the Governor's
exactions on his merchandise.</p>

<p>"Now what advantage," he said, "shall we
derive from this same parting of company, supposing,
as my brother seems to urge, we are still
to consider this Englishman's interest as if he
were our fellow-traveller, and under our especial
protection?"</p>

<p>This personal reasoning pinched the Landamman
somewhat closely, for he had but a short while
before descanted on the generosity of the elder
Philipson, who had freely exposed himself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
danger, rather than that he should embarrass their
negotiation by remaining one of their company;
and it completely shook the fealty of the white-bearded
Nicholas Bonstetten, whose eyes wandered
from the face of Zimmerman, which expressed
triumphant confidence in his argument, to that of
his friend the Landamman, which was rather more
embarrassed than usual.</p>

<p>"Brethren," said Arnold at length with firmness
and animation, "I erred in priding myself
upon the worldly policy which I taught to you
this morning. This man is not of our country,
doubtless, but he is of our blood&mdash;a copy of the
common Creator's image&mdash;and the more worthy of
being called so, as he is a man of integrity and
worth. We might not, without grievous sin, pass
such a person, being in danger, without affording
him relief, even if he lay accidentally by the side
of our path; much less should we abandon him
if the danger has been incurred in our own cause,
and that we might escape the net in which he is
himself caught. Be not, therefore, downcast&mdash;We
do God's will in succouring an oppressed man.
If we succeed by mild means, as I trust we shall,
we do a good action at a cheap rate;&mdash;if not, God
can assert the cause of humanity by the hands of
few as well as of many."</p>

<p>"If such is your opinion," said the Bannerman
of Berne, "not a man here will shrink from you.
For me, I pleaded against my own inclinations
when I advised you to avoid a breach with the
Burgundian. But as a soldier, I must needs say,
I would rather fight the garrison, were they double
the number they talk of, in a fair field, than undertake
to storm their defences."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay," said the Landamman, "I sincerely hope
we shall both enter and depart from the town of
Brisach, without deviating from the pacific character
with which our mission from the Diet
invests us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>For Somerset, off with his guilty head!</p>

<p class="i16"><i>3d Part of Henry VI.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The Governor of La Ferette stood on the battlements
of the eastern entrance-tower of his fortress,
and looked out on the road to Bâle, when first the
vanguard of the Swiss mission, then the centre
and rear, appeared in the distance. At the same
moment the van halting, the main body closed
with it, while the females and baggage, and mules
in the rear, moved in their turn up to the main
body, and the whole were united in one group.</p>

<p>A messenger then stepped forth, and winded one
of those tremendous horns, the spoils of the wild-bulls,
so numerous in the Canton of Uri, that they
are supposed to have given rise to its name.</p>

<p>"They demand admittance," said the esquire.</p>

<p>"They shall have it," answered Sir Archibald
de Hagenbach. "Marry, how they may pass out
again, is another and a deeper question."</p>

<p>"Think yet a moment, noble sir," continued the
esquire. "Bethink you, these Switzers are very
fiends in fight, and have, besides, no booty to
repay the conquest&mdash;some paltry chains of good
copper, perchance, or adulterated silver. You
have knocked out the marrow&mdash;do not damage
your teeth by trying to grind the bone."</p>

<p>"Thou art a fool, Kilian," answered De Hagenbach,
"and it may be a coward besides. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
approach of some score, or at most some score and
a half, of Swiss partisans, makes thee draw in thy
horns like a snail at a child's finger! Mine are
strong and inflexible as those of the Urus, of
whom they talk so much, and on which they blow
so boldly. Keep in mind, thou timid creature,
that if the Swiss deputies, as they presume to call
themselves, are permitted to pass free, they carry
to the Duke stories of merchants bound to his
court, and fraught with precious commodities,
specially addressed to his Grace! Charles has
then at once to endure the presence of the ambassadors,
whom he contemns and hates, and learns
by them that the Governor of La Ferette, permitting
such to pass, has nevertheless presumed to
stop those whom he would full gladly see; for
what prince would not blithely welcome such a
casket as that which we have taken from yonder
strolling English pedlar?"</p>

<p>"I see not how the assault on these ambassadors
will mend your excellency's plea for despoiling
the Englishmen," said Kilian.</p>

<p>"Because thou art a blind mole, Kilian," answered
his chief. "If Burgundy hears of a ruffle
between my garrison and the mountain churls,
whom he scorns, and yet hates, it will drown all
notice of the two pedlars who have perished in the
fray. If after-inquiry should come, an hour's ride
transports me with my confidants into the Imperial
dominions, where, though the Emperor be a spiritless
fool, the rich prize I have found on these
islanders will ensure me a good reception."</p>

<p>"I will stick by your excellency to the last,"
returned the esquire; "and you shall yourself
witness that, if a fool, I am at least no coward."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>"I never thought thee such when it came to
hand-blows," said De Hagenbach; "but in policy
thou art timid and irresolute. Hand me mine
armour, Kilian, and beware thou brace it well.
The Swiss pikes and swords are no wasp-stings."</p>

<p>"May your excellency wear it with honour and
profit," said Kilian; and, according to the duty of
his office, he buckled upon his principal the complete
panoply of a knight of the empire. "Your
purpose of assaulting the Swiss then holds firm,"
said Kilian. "But what pretext will your excellency
assign?"</p>

<p>"Let me alone," said Archibald de Hagenbach,
"to take one, or to make one. Do you only have
Schonfeldt and the soldiers on their stations.
And remember the words are&mdash;'Burgundy to the
Rescue!' When these words are first spoken, let
the soldiers show themselves,&mdash;when repeated,
let them fall on. And now that I am accoutred,
away to the churls and admit them."</p>

<p>Kilian bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>The bugle of the Switzers had repeatedly emitted
its angry roar, exasperated by the delay of
nearly half an hour, without an answer from the
guarded gate of Brisach; and every blast declared,
by the prolonged echoes which it awakened, the
increased impatience of those who summoned the
town. At length the portcullis arose, the gate
opened, the drawbridge fell, and Kilian, in the
equipage of a man-at-arms arrayed for fight, rode
forth on an ambling palfrey.</p>

<p>"What bold men are ye, sirs, who are here in
arms before the fortress of Brisach, appertaining
in right and seignorie to the thrice noble Duke
of Burgundy and Lorraine, and garrisoned for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
cause and interest by the excellent Sir Archibald,
Lord of Hagenbach, Knight of the most Holy
Roman Empire?"</p>

<p>"So please you, Sir Esquire," said the Landamman,
"for such I conjecture you to be by the
feather in your bonnet, we are here with no hostile
intentions; though armed, as you see, to defend
us in a perilous journey, where we are something
unsafe by day, and cannot always repose by night
in places of security. But our arms have no offensive
purpose; if they had such, our numbers had
not been so few as you see them."</p>

<p>"What, then, is your character and purpose?"
said Kilian, who had learned to use, in his master's
absence, the lordly and insolent tone of the
Governor himself.</p>

<p>"We are Delegates," answered the Landamman,
in a calm and even tone of voice, without appearing
to take offence at, or to observe, the insolent
demeanour of the esquire, "from the Free and
Confederated Cantons of the Swiss States and provinces,
and from the good town of Soleure, who
are accredited from our Diet of Legislature to
travel to the presence of his Grace the Duke of
Burgundy, on an errand of high importance to
both countries, and with the hope of establishing
with your master's lord&mdash;I mean with the noble
Duke of Burgundy&mdash;a sure and steadfast peace,
upon such terms as shall be to the mutual honour
and advantage of both countries, and to avert disputes,
and the effusion of Christian blood, which
may otherwise be shed for want of timely and
good understanding."</p>

<p>"Show me your letters of credence," said the
esquire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>"Under your forgiveness, Sir Esquire," replied
the Landamman, "it will be time enough to exhibit
these, when we are admitted to the presence
of your master the Governor."</p>

<p>"That is as much as to say, wilful will to it.
It is well, my masters; and yet you may take this
advice from Kilian of Kersberg. It is sometimes
better to reel backwards than to run forwards.&mdash;My
master, and my master's master, are more ticklish
persons than the dealers of Bâle, to whom you
sell your cheeses. Home, honest men, home! your
way lies before you, and you are fairly warned."</p>

<p>"We thank thee for thy counsel," said the
Landamman, interrupting the Banneret of Berne,
who had commenced an angry reply, "supposing
it kindly meant; if not, an uncivil jest is like an
overcharged gun, which recoils on the cannoneer.
Our road lies onward through Brisach, and onward
we propose to go, and take such hap as that which
we may find before us."</p>

<p>"Go onward then, in the devil's name," said
the squire, who had entertained some hope of
deterring them from pursuing their journey, but
found himself effectually foiled.</p>

<p>The Switzers entered the town, and, stopped by
the barricade of cars which the Governor had
formed across the street, at about twenty yards
from the gate, they drew themselves up in military
order, with their little body formed into three
lines, the two females and the fathers of the deputation
being in the centre. The little phalanx
presented a double front, one to each side of the
street, while the centre line faced so as to move
forward, and only waited for the removal of the
barricade in order to do so. But while they stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
thus inactive, a knight in complete armour appeared
from a side door of the great tower, under
the arch of which they had entered into the town.
His visor was raised, and he walked along the
front of the little line formed by the Swiss, with
a stern and frowning aspect.</p>

<p>"Who are you," he said, "who have thus far
intruded yourselves in arms into a Burgundian
garrison?"</p>

<p>"With your excellency's leave," said the Landamman,
"we are men who come on a peaceful
errand, though we carry arms for our own defence.
Deputies we are from the towns of Berne and
Soleure, the Cantons of Uri, Schwitz, and Unterwalden,
come to adjust matters of importance with
the gracious Duke of Burgundy and Lorraine."</p>

<p>"What towns, what cantons?" said the Governor
of La Ferette. "I have heard no such names
among the Free Cities of Germany.&mdash;Berne, truly!
when became Berne a free state?"</p>

<p>"Since the twenty-first day of June," said
Arnold Biederman, "in the year of grace one thousand
three hundred and thirty-nine, on which day
the battle of Laupen was fought."</p>

<p>"Away, vain old man!" said the Knight.
"Thinkest thou that such idle boasts can avail
thee here? We have heard, indeed, of some insurgent
villages and communities among the Alps,
and how they rebelled against the Emperor, and
by the advantage of fastnesses, ambuscades, and
lurking-places, how they have murdered some
knights and gentlemen sent against them by the
Duke of Austria; but we little thought that such
paltry townships and insignificant bands of mutineers
had the insolence to term themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Free States, and propose to enter into negotiation
as such with a mighty prince like Charles of
Burgundy."</p>

<p>"May it please your excellency," replied the
Landamman, with perfect temper; "your own laws
of chivalry declare, that if the stronger wrong the
weaker, or the noble does injury to the less gentle,
the very act levels distinctions between them, and
the doer of an injury becomes bound to give condign
satisfaction, of such kind as the wronged
party shall demand."</p>

<p>"Hence to thy hills, churl!" exclaimed the
haughty Knight; "there comb thy beard and roast
thy chestnuts. What! because a few rats and
mice find retreat among the walls and wainscoting
of our dwelling-houses, shall we therefore allow
them to intrude their disgusting presence, and
their airs of freedom and independence, into our
personal presence? No, we will rather crush them
beneath the heel of our ironshod boots."</p>

<p>"We are not men to be trodden on," said Arnold
Biederman, calmly; "those who have attempted it
have found us stumbling-blocks. Lay, Sir Knight,
lay aside for an instant this haughty language,
which can only lead to warfare, and listen to the
words of peace. Dismiss our comrade, the English
merchant Philipson, on whom you have this morning
laid unlawful hands; let him pay a moderate
sum for his ransom, and we, who are bound instantly
to the Duke's presence, will bear a fair
report to him of his Governor of La Ferette."</p>

<p>"You will be so generous, will you!" said Sir
Archibald, in a tone of ridicule. "And what
pledge shall I have that you will favour me so
kindly as you propose?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>"The word of a man who never broke his promise,"
answered the stoical Landamman.</p>

<p>"Insolent hind!" replied the Knight, "dost
thou stipulate? <i>Thou</i> offer thy paltry word as
a pledge betwixt the Duke of Burgundy and Archibald
de Hagenbach? Know that ye go not to
Burgundy at all, or you go thither with fetters on
your hands and halters round your necks.&mdash;So
ho, Burgundy to the Rescue!"</p>

<p>Instantly, as he spoke, the soldiers showed
themselves before, behind, and around the narrow
space where the Swiss had drawn themselves up.
The battlements of the town were lined with men,
others presented themselves at the doors of each
house in the street, prepared to sally, and, at the
windows, prepared to shoot, as well with guns as
with bows and crossbows. The soldiers who defended
the barricade also started up, and seemed
ready to dispute the passage in front. The little
band, encompassed and overmatched, but neither
startled nor disheartened, stood to their arms.
The centre rank under the Landamman prepared
to force their way over the barricade. The two
fronts stood back to back, ready to dispute the
street with those that should issue from the
houses. It could not fail to prove a work of no
small blood and toil to subdue this handful of
determined men, even with five times their
number. Some sense of this, perhaps, made Sir
Archibald delay giving the signal for onset, when
suddenly behind arose a cry of, "Treason, treason!"</p>

<p>A soldier, covered with mud, rushed before the
Governor, and said, in hurried accents, that, as he
endeavoured to stop a prisoner who had made his
escape some short time since, he had been seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
by the burghers of the town, and well-nigh drowned
in the moat. He added, that the citizens were
even now admitting the enemy into the place.</p>

<p>"Kilian," said the Knight, "take two score of
men&mdash;hasten to the northern sallyport; stab, cut
down, or throw from the battlements, whomsoever
you meet in arms, townsmen or strangers. Leave me
to settle with these peasants by fair means or foul."</p>

<p>But ere Kilian could obey his master's commands,
a shout arose in the rear, where they cried,
"Bâle! Bâle!&mdash;Freedom! freedom!&mdash;The day is
our own!"</p>

<p>Onward came the youth of Bâle, who had not
been at such a distance but that Rudolph had contrived
to recall them&mdash;onward came many Swiss
who had hovered around the embassy, holding
themselves in readiness for such a piece of service;
and onward came the armed citizens of La
Ferette, who, compelled to take arms and mount
guard by the tyranny of De Hagenbach, had
availed themselves of the opportunity to admit the
Bâlese at the sallyport through which Philipson
had lately made his escape.</p>

<p>The garrison, somewhat discouraged before by
the firm aspect of the Swiss, who had held their
numbers at defiance, were totally disconcerted by
this new and unexpected insurrection. Most of
them prepared rather to fly than to fight, and they
threw themselves in numbers from the walls, as
the best chance of escaping. Kilian and some
others, whom pride prevented from flying, and
despair from asking quarter, fought with fury, and
were killed on the spot. In the midst of this
confusion the Landamman kept his own bands
unmoved, permitting them to take no share in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
action, save to repel such violence as was offered
to them.</p>

<p>"Stand fast all!" sounded the deep voice of
Arnold Biederman along their little body. "Where
is Rudolph?&mdash;Save lives, but take none.&mdash;Why,
how now, Arthur Philipson! stand fast, I say."</p>

<p>"I cannot stand fast," said Arthur, who was
in the act of leaving the ranks. "I must seek
my father in the dungeons; they may be slaying
him in this confusion while I stand idle here."</p>

<p>"By our Lady of Einsiedlen, you say well,"
answered the Landamman; "that I should have
forgot my noble guest! I will help thee to search
for him, Arthur&mdash;the affray seems well-nigh
ended.&mdash;Ho, there, Sir Banneret, worthy Adam
Zimmerman, my good friend Nicholas Bonstetten,
keep our men standing firm&mdash;Have nothing to do
with this affray, but leave the men of Bâle to
answer their own deeds. I return in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>So saying, he hurried after Arthur Philipson,
whose recollection conducted him, with sufficient
accuracy, to the head of the dungeon stairs. There
they met an ill-looking man clad in a buff jerkin,
who bore at his girdle a bunch of rusted keys,
which intimated the nature of his calling.</p>

<p>"Show me the prison of the English merchant,"
said Arthur Philipson, "or thou diest by
my hand!"</p>

<p>"Which of them desire you to see?" answered
the official;&mdash;"the old man, or the young one?"</p>

<p>"The old," said young Philipson. "His son
has escaped thee."</p>

<p>"Enter here then, gentlemen," said the jailer,
undoing the spring-bolt of a heavy door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>At the upper end of the apartment lay the man
they came to seek for, who was instantly raised
from the ground, and loaded with their embraces.</p>

<p>"My dear father!"&mdash;"My worthy guest!" said
his son and friend at the same moment, "how
fares it with you?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered the elder Philipson, "if you,
my friend, and son, come, as I judge from your
arms and countenance, as conquerors, and at
liberty&mdash;ill, if you come to share my prison-house."</p>

<p>"Have no fear of that," said the Landamman;
"we have been in danger, but are remarkably
delivered.&mdash;Your evil lair has benumbed you.
Lean on me, my noble guest, and let me assist you
to better quarters."</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by a heavy clash, as it
seemed, of iron, and differing from the distant
roar of the popular tumult, which they still heard
from the open street, as men hear the deep voice
of a remote and tempestuous ocean.</p>

<p>"By St. Peter of the fetters!" said Arthur, who
instantly discovered the cause of the sound, "the
jailer has cast the door to the staple, or it has
escaped his grasp. The spring-lock has closed
upon us, and we cannot be liberated saving from
the outside.&mdash;Ho, jailer dog! villain! open the
door, or thou diest!"</p>

<p>"He is probably out of hearing of your threats,"
said the elder Philipson, "and your cries avail you
nothing. But are you sure the Swiss are in possession
of the town?"</p>

<p>"We are peaceful occupants of it," answered
the Landamman, "though without a blow given
on our side."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, then," said the Englishman, "your followers
will soon find you out. Arthur and I are
paltry ciphers, and our absence might easily pass
over unobserved; but you are too important a
figure not to be missed and looked after, when
the sum of your number is taken."</p>

<p>"I well hope it will prove so," said the Landamman,
"though methinks I show but scurvily,
shut up here like a cat in a cupboard when he has
been stealing cream.&mdash;Arthur, my brave boy, dost
thou see no means of shooting back the bolt?"</p>

<p>Arthur, who had been minutely examining the
lock, replied in the negative; and added, that they
must take patience perforce, and arm themselves
to wait calmly their deliverance, which they could
do nothing to accelerate.</p>

<p>Arnold Biederman, however, felt somewhat severely
the neglect of his sons and companions.</p>

<p>"All my youths, uncertain whether I am alive
or dead, are taking the opportunity of my absence,
doubtless, for pillage and licence&mdash;and the politic
Rudolph, I presume, cares not if I should never
reappear on the stage&mdash;the Banneret, and the
white-bearded fool Bonstetten, who calls me his
friend&mdash;every neighbour has deserted me&mdash;and
yet they know that I am anxious for the safety of
the most insignificant of them all, as dearer to me
than my own. By heavens! it looks like stratagem;
and shows as if the rash young men desired
to get rid of a rule too regular and peaceful to
be pleasing to those who are eager for war and
conquest."</p>

<p>The Landamman, fretted out of his usual serenity
of temper, and afraid of the misbehaviour of
his countrymen in his absence, thus reflected upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
his friends and companions, while the distant
noise soon died away into the most absolute and
total silence.</p>

<p>"What is to do now?" said Arthur Philipson.
"I trust they will take the opportunity of quiet
to go through the roll-call, and inquire then who
are a-missing."</p>

<p>It seemed as if the young man's wish had some
efficacy, for he had scarce uttered it before the lock
was turned, and the door set ajar by some one who
escaped upstairs from behind it, before those who
were set at liberty could obtain a glance of their
deliverer.</p>

<p>"It is the jailer, doubtless," said the Landamman,
"who may be apprehensive, as he has some
reason, that we might prove more incensed at our
detention in the dungeon, than grateful for our
deliverance."</p>

<p>As they spoke thus they ascended the narrow
stairs, and issued from the door of the Gate-house
tower, where a singular spectacle awaited them.
The Swiss Deputies and their escort still remained
standing fast and firm on the very spot where
Hagenbach had proposed to assail them. A few
of the late Governor's soldiers, disarmed, and
cowering from the rage of a multitude of the citizens,
who now filled the streets, stood with downcast
looks behind the phalanx of the mountaineers, as
their safest place of retreat. But this was not all.</p>

<p>The cars, so lately placed to obstruct the passage
of the street, were now joined together, and served
to support a platform, or scaffold, which had been
hastily constructed of planks. On this was placed
a chair, in which sat a tall man, with his head,
neck, and shoulders bare, the rest of his body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
clothed in bright armour. His countenance was
as pale as death, yet young Philipson recognised
the hard-hearted Governor, Sir Archibald Hagenbach.
He appeared to be bound to the chair. On
his right, and close beside him, stood the Priest of
St. Paul's, muttering prayers, with his breviary
in his hand; while on his left, and somewhat
behind the captive, appeared a tall man, attired in
red [<a href="#ednote_h" name="enanchor_h" id="enanchor_h" ><i>h</i></a>], and leaning with both hands on the naked
sword, which has been described on a former occasion.
The instant that Arnold Biederman appeared,
and before the Landamman could open his
lips to demand the meaning of what he saw, the
priest drew back, the executioner stepped forward,
the sword was brandished, the blow was struck,
and the victim's head rolled on the scaffold. A
general acclamation and clapping of hands, like
that by which a crowded theatre approves of some
well-graced performer, followed this feat of dexterity.
While the headless corpse shot streams
from the arteries, which were drunk up by the
sawdust that strewed the scaffold, the executioner
gracefully presented himself alternately at the four
corners of the stage, modestly bowing, as the multitude
greeted him with cheers of approbation.</p>

<p>"Nobles, knights, gentlemen of free-born blood,
and good citizens," he said, "who have assisted
at this act of high justice, I pray you to bear me
witness that this judgment hath been executed
after the form of the sentence, at one blow, and
without stroke missed or repeated."</p>

<p>The acclamations were reiterated.</p>

<p>"Long live our Scharfgerichter Steinernherz,
and many a tyrant may he do his duty on!"</p>

<p>"Noble friends," said the executioner, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
deepest obeisance, "I have yet another word to
say, and it must be a proud one.&mdash;God be gracious
to the soul of this good and noble knight, Sir
Archibald de Hagenbach. He was the patron of
my youth, and my guide to the path of honour.
Eight steps have I made towards freedom and
nobility on the heads of freeborn knights and
nobles, who have fallen by his authority and command;
and the ninth, by which I have attained
it, is upon his own, in grateful memory of which
I will expend this purse of gold, which but an
hour since he bestowed on me, in masses for his
soul. Gentlemen, noble friends, and now my
equals, La Ferette has lost a nobleman and gained
one. Our Lady be gracious to the departed knight,
Sir Archibald de Hagenbach, and bless and prosper
the progress of Stephen Steinernherz von Blutsacker,
now free and noble of right!"<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>With that he took the feather out of the cap of
the deceased, which, soiled with the blood of the
wearer, lay near his body upon the scaffold, and,
putting it into his own official bonnet, received
the homage of the crowd in loud huzzas, which
were partly in earnest, partly in ridicule of such
an unusual transformation.</p>

<p>Arnold Biederman at length found breath, which
the extremity of surprise had at first denied him.
Indeed, the whole execution had passed much too
rapidly for the possibility of his interference.</p>

<p>"Who has dared to act this tragedy?" he said
indignantly. "And by what right has it taken
place?"</p>

<p>A cavalier, richly dressed in blue, replied to the
question&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>"The free citizens of Bâle have acted for themselves,
as the fathers of Swiss liberty set them
an example; and the tyrant, De Hagenbach, has
fallen by the same right which put to death the
tyrant Geysler. We bore with him till his cup
was brimming over, and then we bore no longer."</p>

<p>"I say not but that he deserved death," replied
the Landamman; "but for your own sake, and for
ours, you should have forborne him till the Duke's
pleasure was known."</p>

<p>"What tell you us of the Duke?" answered
Laurenz Neipperg, the same blue cavalier whom
Arthur had seen at the secret rendezvous of the
Bâlese youth, in company with Rudolph. "Why
talk you of Burgundy to us, who are none of his
subjects? The Emperor, our only rightful lord,
had no title to pawn the town and fortifications of
La Ferette, being as it is a dependency of Bâle, to
the prejudice of our free city. He might have
pledged the revenue indeed; and supposing him to
have done so, the debt has been paid twice over
by the exactions levied by yonder oppressor, who
has now received his due. But pass on, Landamman
of Unterwalden. If our actions displease
you, abjure them at the footstool of the Duke of
Burgundy; but, in doing so, abjure the memory
of William Tell and Stauffacher, of Furst and
Melchtal, the fathers of Swiss freedom."</p>

<p>"You speak truth," said the Landamman; "but
it is in an ill-chosen and unhappy time. Patience
would have remedied your evils, which none felt
more deeply, or would have redressed more willingly,
than I. But oh, imprudent young man,
you have thrown aside the modesty of your age,
and the subjection you owe to your elders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
William Tell and his brethren were men of years
and judgment, husbands and fathers, having a
right to be heard in council, and to be foremost in
action. Enough&mdash;I leave it with the fathers and
senators of your own city, to acknowledge or to
reprove your actions.&mdash;But you, my friends,&mdash;you,
Banneret of Berne,&mdash;you, Rudolph,&mdash;above
all, you, Nicholas Bonstetten, my comrade and
my friend, why did you not take this miserable
man under your protection? The action would
have shown Burgundy that we were slandered by
those who have declared us desirous of seeking a
quarrel with him, or of inciting his subjects to
revolt. Now, all these prejudices will be confirmed
in the minds of men, naturally more tenacious
of evil impressions than of those which are
favourable."</p>

<p>"As I live by bread, good gossip and neighbour,"
answered Nicholas Bonstetten, "I thought
to obey your injunctions to a tittle; so much so,
that I once thought of breaking in and protecting
the man, when Rudolph Donnerhugel reminded
me that your last orders were, to stand firm, and
let the men of Bâle answer for their own actions;
and surely, said I to myself, my gossip Arnold
knows better than all of us what is fitting to be
done."</p>

<p>"Ah, Rudolph, Rudolph," said the Landamman,
looking on him with a displeased countenance,
"wert thou not ashamed thus to deceive an old
man?"</p>

<p>"To say I deceived him is a hard charge; but
from you, Landamman," answered the Bernese,
with his usual deference, "I can bear anything.
I will only say, that, being a member of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
embassy, I am obliged to think, and to give my
opinion as such, especially when he is not present
who is wise enough to lead and direct us all."</p>

<p>"Thy words are always fair, Rudolph," replied
Arnold Biederman, "and I trust so is thy meaning.
Yet there are times when I somewhat doubt it.&mdash;But
let disputes pass, and let me have your advice,
my friends; and for that purpose go we where it
may best profit us, even to the church, where we
will first return our thanks for our deliverance
from assassination, and then hold counsel what
next is to be done."</p>

<p>The Landamman led the way, accordingly, to
the church of St. Paul's, while his companions
and associates followed in their order. This gave
Rudolph, who, as youngest, suffered the others to
precede him, an opportunity to beckon to him the
Landamman's eldest son, Rudiger, and whisper to
him to get rid of the two English merchants.</p>

<p>"Away with them, my dear Rudiger, by fair
means, if possible; but away with them directly.
Thy father is besotted with these two English
pedlars, and will listen to no other counsel; and
thou and I know, dearest Rudiger, that such men
as these are unfit to give laws to free-born Switzers.
Get the trumpery they have been robbed of, or as
much of it as is extant, together as fast as thou
canst, and send them a-travelling, in Heaven's
name."</p>

<p>Rudiger nodded intelligently, and went to offer
his services to expedite the departure of the elder
Philipson. He found the sagacious merchant as
desirous to escape from the scene of confusion now
presented in the town, as the young Swiss could
be to urge his departure. He only waited to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
recover the casket of which De Hagenbach had
possessed himself, and Rudiger Biederman set on
foot a strict search after it, which was the more
likely to be successful, that the simplicity of the
Swiss prevented them from setting the true value
upon its contents. A strict and hasty search was
immediately instituted, both on the person of the
dead De Hagenbach, on which the precious packet
was not to be found, and on all who had approached
him at his execution, or were supposed to enjoy his
confidence.</p>

<p>Young Arthur Philipson would gladly have
availed himself of a few moments to bid farewell
to Anne of Geierstein. But the grey wimple was
no longer seen in the ranks of the Switzers, and it
was reasonable to think that, in the confusion
which followed the execution of De Hagenbach,
and the retreat of the leaders of the little battalion,
she had made her escape into some of the adjacent
houses, while the soldiers around her, no longer
restrained by the presence of their chiefs, had dispersed,
some to search for the goods of which the
Englishmen had been despoiled, others doubtless
to mingle with and join in the rejoicings of the
victorious youths of Bâle, and of those burghers of
La Ferette by whom the fortifications of the town
had been so gently surrendered.</p>

<p>The cry amongst them was universal, that
Brisach, so long considered as the curb of the
Swiss confederates, and the barrier against their
commerce, should henceforth be garrisoned, as
their protection against the encroachments and
exactions of the Duke of Burgundy and his officers.
The whole town was in a wild but joyful jubilee,
while the citizens vied with each other in offering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
to the Swiss every species of refreshment, and the
youths who attended upon the mission hurried
gaily, and in triumph, to profit by the circumstances,
which had so unexpectedly converted the
ambuscade so treacherously laid for them, into a
genial and joyous reception.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i355" id="i355"></a>

<p class="caption">THE EXECUTION.<br />

</div>

<p>Amid this scene of confusion, it was impossible
for Arthur to quit his father, even to satisfy the
feelings which induced him to wish for a few
moments at his own disposal. Sad, thoughtful,
and sorrowful, amid the general joy, he remained
with the parent whom he had so much reason to
love and honour, to assist him in securing and
placing on their mule the various packages and
bales which the honest Switzers had recovered
after the death of De Hagenbach, and which they
emulated each other in bringing to their rightful
owner; while they were with difficulty prevailed
on to accept the guerdon which the Englishman,
from the means which he had still left upon his
person, was disposed not merely to offer but to
force upon the restorers of his property, and which,
in their rude and simple ideas, seemed greatly to
exceed the value of what they had recovered for
him.</p>

<p>This scene had scarcely lasted ten or fifteen
minutes, when Rudolph Donnerhugel approached
the elder Philipson, and in a tone of great courtesy
invited him to join the council of the Chiefs of
the Embassy of the Swiss Cantons, who, he said,
were desirous of having the advantage of his experience
upon some important questions respecting
their conduct on these unexpected occurrences.</p>

<p>"See to our affairs, Arthur, and stir not from
the spot on which I leave you," said Philipson to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
his son. "Look especially after the sealed packet
of which I was so infamously and illegally robbed:
its recovery is of the utmost consequence."</p>

<p>So speaking, he instantly prepared himself to
attend the Bernese, who in a confidential manner
whispered, as he went arm-in-arm with him
towards the church of St. Paul's,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think a man of your wisdom will scarce
advise us to trust ourselves to the mood of the
Duke of Burgundy, when he has received such an
injury as the loss of this fortress, and the execution
of his officer. You, at least, would be too
judicious to afford us any further the advantage of
your company and society, since to do so would be
wilfully to engage in our shipwreck."</p>

<p>"I will give my best advice," answered Philipson,
"when I shall be more particularly acquainted
with the circumstances under which it is asked
of me."</p>

<p>Rudolph muttered an oath, or angry exclamation,
and led Philipson to the church without
further argument.</p>

<p>In a small chapel adjoining to the church, and
dedicated to St. Magnus the Martyr, the four
deputies were assembled in close conclave, around
the shrine in which the sainted hero stood, armed
as when he lived. The Priest of St. Paul's was
also present, and seemed to interest himself deeply
in the debate which was taking place. When Philipson
entered, all were for a moment silent, until
the Landamman addressed him thus: "Seignor
Philipson, we esteem you a man far travelled,
well versed in the manners of foreign lands, and
acquainted with the conditions of this Duke
Charles of Burgundy; you are therefore fit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
advise us in a matter of great weight. You know
with what anxiety we go on this mission for peace
with the Duke; you also know what has this day
happened, which may probably be represented to
Charles in the worst colours. Would you advise
us, in such a case, to proceed to the Duke's presence,
with the odium of this action attached to
us? or should we do better to return home, and
prepare for war with Burgundy?"</p>

<p>"How do your own opinions stand on the subject?"
said the cautious Englishman.</p>

<p>"We are divided," answered the Banneret of
Berne. "I have borne the banner of Berne against
her foes for thirty years; I am more willing to
carry it against the lances of the knights of Hainault
and Lorraine, than to undergo the rude
treatment which we must look to meet at the
footstool of the Duke."</p>

<p>"We put our heads in the lion's mouth if we go
forward," said Zimmerman of Soleure;&mdash;"my
opinion is, that we draw back."</p>

<p>"I would not advise retreat," said Rudolph
Donnerhugel, "were my life alone concerned; but
the Landamman of Unterwalden is the father of
the United Cantons, and it would be parricide if
I consented to put his life in peril. My advice is,
that we return, and that the Confederacy stand on
their defence."</p>

<p>"My opinion is different," said Arnold Biederman;
"nor will I forgive any man who, whether
in sincere or feigned friendship, places my poor
life in the scale with the advantage of the Cantons.
If we go forward, we risk our heads&mdash;be it so.
But if we turn back, we involve our country in
war with a power of the first magnitude in Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Worthy citizens! you are brave in fight&mdash;show
your fortitude as boldly now; and let us not hesitate
to incur such personal danger as may attend
ourselves, if by doing so we can gain a chance of
peace for our country."</p>

<p>"I think and vote with my neighbour and gossip,
Arnold Biederman," said the laconic deputy
from Schwitz.</p>

<p>"You hear how we are divided in opinion," said
the Landamman to Philipson. "What is your
opinion?"</p>

<p>"I would first ask of you," said the Englishman,
"what has been your part in this storming of a
town occupied by the Duke's forces, and putting
to death his Governor?"</p>

<p>"So help me, Heaven!" said the Landamman,
"as I knew not of any purpose of storming the
town until it unexpectedly took place."</p>

<p>"And for the execution of De Hagenbach," said
the Black Priest, "I swear to you, stranger, by my
holy order, that it took place under the direction
of a competent court, whose sentence Charles of
Burgundy himself is bound to respect, and whose
proceedings the deputies of the Swiss mission could
neither have advanced nor retarded."</p>

<p>"If such be the case, and if you can really prove
yourselves free of these proceedings," answered
Philipson, "which must needs be highly resented
by the Duke of Burgundy, I would advise you by
all means to proceed upon your journey; with the
certainty that you will obtain from that prince a
just and impartial hearing, and it may be a favourable
answer. I know Charles of Burgundy; I may
even say that, our different ranks and walks of life
considered, I know him well. He will be deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
incensed by the first tidings of what has here
chanced, which he will no doubt interpret to your
disfavour. But if, in the course of investigation,
you are able to clear yourselves of these foul imputations,
a sense of his own injustice may perhaps
turn the balance in your favour, and in that case
he will rush from the excess of censure into that
of indulgence. But your cause must be firmly
stated to the Duke, by some tongue better acquainted
with the language of courts than yours;
and such a friendly interpreter might I have proved
to you, had I not been plundered of the valuable
packet which I bore with me in order to present to
the Duke, and in testimony of my commission to
him."</p>

<p>"A paltry fetch," whispered Donnerhugel to the
Banneret, "that the trader may obtain from us
satisfaction for the goods of which he has been
plundered."</p>

<p>The Landamman himself was perhaps for a
moment of the same opinion.</p>

<p>"Merchant," he said, "we hold ourselves bound
to make good to you&mdash;that is, if our substance
can effect it&mdash;whatever loss you may have sustained,
trusting to our protection."</p>

<p>"Ay, that we will," said the old man of Schwitz,
"should it cost us twenty zechins to make it good."</p>

<p>"To your guarantee of immunity I can have no
claim," said Philipson, "seeing I parted company
with you before I sustained any loss. And I
regret the loss, not so much for its value, although
that is greater than you may fancy; but chiefly
because, that the contents of the casket I bore
being a token betwixt a person of considerable
importance and the Duke of Burgundy, I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
not, I fear, now that I am deprived of them,
receive from his grace that credence which I
desire, both for my own sake and yours. Without
them, and speaking only in the person of a private
traveller, I may not take upon me as I might have
done, when using the names of the persons whose
mandates I carried."</p>

<p>"This important packet," said the Landamman,
"shall be most rigorously sought for, and carefully
re-delivered to thee. For ourselves, not a Swiss
of us knows the value of its contents; so that if
they are in the hands of any of our men, they
will be returned of course as baubles, upon which
they set no value."</p>

<p>As he spoke, there was a knocking at the door
of the chapel. Rudolph, who stood nearest to it,
having held some communication with those without,
observed with a smile, which he instantly
repressed, lest it had given offence to Arnold
Biederman,&mdash;"It is Sigismund, the good youth&mdash;Shall
I admit him to our council?"</p>

<p>"To what purpose, poor simple lad?" said his
father, with a sorrowful smile.</p>

<p>"Yet let me undo the door," said Philipson;
"he is anxious to enter, and perhaps he brings
news. I have observed, Landamman, that the
young man, though with slowness of ideas and
expression, is strong in his principles, and sometimes
happy in his conceptions."</p>

<p>He admitted Sigismund accordingly; while
Arnold Biederman felt, on the one hand, the
soothing compliment which Philipson had paid to
a boy, certainly the dullest of his family, and, on
the other, feared some public display of his son's
infirmity, or lack of understanding. Sigismund,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
however, seemed all confidence; and he certainly
had reason to be so, since, as the shortest mode of
explanation, he presented to Philipson the necklace
of diamonds, with the casket in which it had
been deposited.</p>

<p>"This pretty thing is yours," he said. "I
understand so much from your son Arthur, who
tells me you will be glad to have it again."</p>

<p>"Most cordially do I thank you," said the merchant.
"The necklace is certainly mine; that is,
the packet of which it formed the contents was
under my charge; and it is at this moment of
greater additional value to me than even its actual
worth, since it serves as my pledge and token for
the performance of an important mission.&mdash;And
how, my young friend," he continued, addressing
Sigismund, "have you been so fortunate as to
recover what we have sought for hitherto in vain?
Let me return my best acknowledgments; and do
not think me over-curious if I ask how it reached
you."</p>

<p>"For that matter," said Sigismund, "the story
is soon told. I had planted myself as near the
scaffold as I could, having never beheld an execution
before; and I observed the executioner, who I
thought did his duty very cleverly, just in the
moment that he spread a cloth over the body of
De Hagenbach, snatch something from the dead
man's bosom, and huddle it hastily into his own;
so, when the rumour arose that an article of value
was a-missing, I hurried in quest of the fellow. I
found he had bespoke masses to the extent of a
hundred crowns at the high altar of St. Paul's;
and I traced him to the tavern of the village,
where some ill-looking men were joyously drinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
to him as a free citizen and a nobleman. So I
stepped in amongst them with my partisan, and
demanded of his lordship either to surrender to me
what he had thus possessed himself of, or to try
the weight of the weapon I carried. His lordship,
my Lord Hangman, hesitated, and was about to
make a brawl. But I was something peremptory,
and so he judged it best to give me the parcel,
which I trust you, Seignor Philipson, will find
safe and entire as it was taken from you. And&mdash;and&mdash;I
left them to conclude their festivities&mdash;and
that is the whole of the story."</p>

<p>"Thou art a brave lad," said Philipson; "and
with a heart always right, the head can seldom be
far wrong. But the Church shall not lose its dues,
and I take it on myself, ere I leave La Ferette, to
pay for the masses which the man had ordered for
the sake of De Hagenbach's soul, snatched from
the world so unexpectedly."</p>

<p>Sigismund was about to reply; but Philipson,
fearing he might bring out some foolery to diminish
the sense which his father had so joyously
entertained of his late conduct, immediately added,
"Hie away, my good youth, and give to my son
Arthur this precious casket."</p>

<p>With simple exultation at receiving applause to
which he was little accustomed, Sigismund took
his leave, and the council were once more left to
their own privacy.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; for the Landamman
could not overcome the feeling of exquisite
pleasure at the sagacity which poor Sigismund,
whose general conduct warranted no such expectations,
had displayed on the present occasion. It
was not, however, a feeling to which circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
permitted him to give vent, and he reserved
it for his own secret enjoyment, as a solace to the
anxiety which he had hitherto entertained concerning
the limited intellect of this simple-minded
young man. When he spoke, it was to Philipson,
with the usual candour and manliness of his
character.</p>

<p>"Seignor Philipson," he said, "we will hold
you bound by no offer which you made while these
glittering matters were out of your possession;
because a man may often think that if he were in
such and such a situation he would be able to
achieve certain ends which, that position being
attained, he may find himself unable to accomplish.
But I now ask you, whether, having thus
fortunately and unexpectedly regained possession
of what you say will give you certain credence
with the Duke of Burgundy, you conceive yourself
entitled to mediate with him on our behalf, as you
formerly proposed?"</p>

<p>All bent forward to hear the merchant's answer.</p>

<p>"Landamman," he replied, "I never spoke the
word in difficulty which I was not ready to redeem
when that difficulty was removed. You say, and
I believe, that you had no concern with this
storming of La Ferette. You say also, that the
life of De Hagenbach was taken by a judicature
over which you had no control, and exercised
none&mdash;let a protocol be drawn up, averring these
circumstances, and, as far as possible, proving
them. Intrust it to me&mdash;under seal if you will&mdash;and
if such points be established, I will pledge
my word as a&mdash;as a&mdash;as an honest man and a
true-born Englishman, that the Duke of Burgundy
will neither detain nor offer you any personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
injury. I also hope to show to Charles strong and
weighty reasons why a league of friendship betwixt
Burgundy and the United Cantons of Helvetia is,
on his grace's part, a wise and generous measure.
But it is possible I may fail in this last point;
and if I do, I shall deeply grieve for it. In warranting
your safe passage to the Duke's court, and
your safe return from it to your own country, I
think I cannot fail. If I do, my own life, and
that of my beloved and only child, shall pay the
ransom for my excess of confidence in the Duke's
justice and honour."</p>

<p>The other deputies stood silent, and looked on
the Landamman; but Rudolph Donnerhugel spoke.</p>

<p>"Are we then to trust our own lives, and, what
is still dearer to us, that of our honoured associate,
Arnold Biederman, on the simple word of a foreign
trader? We all know the temper of the Duke,
and how vindictively and relentlessly he has ever
felt towards our country and its interests. Methinks
this English merchant should express the
nature of his interest at the court of Burgundy
more plainly, if he expects us to place such implicit
reliance in it."</p>

<p>"That, Seignor Rudolph Donnerhugel," replied
the merchant, "I find myself not at liberty to do.
I pry not into your secrets, whether they belong
to you as a body or as individuals. My own are
sacred. If I consulted my own safety merely, I
should act most wisely to part company with you
here. But the object of your mission is peace;
and your sudden return, after what has chanced at
La Ferette, will make war inevitable. I think I
can assure you of a safe and free audience from
the Duke, and I am willing, for the chance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
securing the peace of Christendom, to encounter
any personal peril which may attach to myself."</p>

<p>"Say no more, worthy Philipson," said the
Landamman; "thy good faith is undoubted on our
part, and ill luck is his who cannot read it written
on thy manly forehead. We go forward, then,
prepared to risk our own safety at the hand of a
despotic prince, rather than leave undischarged
the mission which our country has intrusted us
with. He is but half a brave man who will risk
his life only in the field of battle. There are
other dangers, to front which is equally honourable;
and since the weal of Switzerland demands
that we should encounter them, not one of us will
hesitate to take the risk."</p>

<p>The other members of the mission bowed in
assent, and the conclave broke up to prepare for
their farther entrance into Burgundy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Upon the mountain's heathery side,</p>
<p class="i1">The day's last lustre shone,</p>
<p>And rich with many a radiant hue,</p>
<p class="i1">Gleam'd gaily on the Rhone.</p>

<p class="i16"><span class="smcap">Southey.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>The English merchant was now much consulted by
the Swiss Commissioners in all their motions. He
exhorted them to proceed with all despatch on
their journey, so as to carry to the Duke their own
account of the affair of Brisach, and thus anticipate
all rumours less favourable to their conduct on the
occasion. For this purpose Philipson recommended
that the Deputies, dismissing their escort, whose
arms and numbers might give umbrage and suspicion,
while they were too few for defence, should
themselves proceed by rapid journeys on horseback
towards Dijon, or wherever the Duke might chance
to be for the time.</p>

<p>This proposal was, however, formally resisted
by the very person who had hitherto been the most
ductile of the party, and the willing echo of the
Landamman's pleasure. On the present occasion,
notwithstanding that Arnold Biederman declared
the advice of Philipson excellent, Nicholas Bonstetten
stood in absolute and insurmountable opposition;
because, having hitherto trusted to his
own limbs for transporting himself to and fro on
all occasions, he could by no means be persuaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
to commit himself to the discretion of a horse.
As he was found obstinately positive on this
subject, it was finally determined that the two
Englishmen should press forward on their journey,
with such speed as they might, and that the
elder of them should make the Duke acquainted
with so much as to the capture of La Ferette
as he had himself witnessed of the matter. The
particulars which had attended the death of De
Hagenbach, the Landamman assured him, would
be sent to the Duke by a person of confidence,
whose attestation on the subject could not be
doubted.</p>

<p>This course was adopted, as Philipson expressed
his confidence of getting an early and private audience
with his grace of Burgundy.</p>

<p>"My best intercession," he said, "you have a
good right to reckon upon; and no one can bear
more direct testimony than I can to the ungovernable
cruelty and rapacity of De Hagenbach, of
which I had so nearly been the victim. But of
his trial and execution I neither know nor can tell
anything; and as Duke Charles is sure to demand
why execution was done upon his officer without
an appeal to his own tribunal, it will be well
that you either provide me with such facts as you
have to state, or send forward, at least, as speedily
as possible, the evidence which you have to lay
before him on that most weighty branch of the
subject."</p>

<p>The proposal of the merchant created some visible
embarrassment on the countenance of the
Swiss, and it was with obvious hesitation that
Arnold Biederman, having led him aside, addressed
him in a whisper&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<p>"My good friend," he said, "mysteries are in
general like the hateful mists which disfigure the
noblest features of nature; yet, like mists, they
will sometimes intervene when we most desire
their absence, when we most desire to be plain and
explicit. The manner of De Hagenbach's death
you saw&mdash;we will take care that the Duke is
informed of the authority by which it was inflicted.
This is all that I can at present tell you
on the subject; and let me add, that the less you
speak of it with any one, you will be the more
likely to escape inconvenience."</p>

<p>"Worthy Landamman," said the Englishman,
"I also am by nature, and from the habits of my
country, a hater of mysteries. Yet, such is my
firm confidence in your truth and honour, that you
shall be my guide in these dark and secret transactions,
even as amongst the mists and precipices
of your native land, and I rest contented in either
case to place unlimited confidence in your sagacity.
Let me only recommend that your explanation with
Charles be instant, as well as clear and candid.
Such being the case, I trust my poor interest with
the Duke may be reckoned for something in your
favour. Here then we part, but, as I trust, soon
to meet again."</p>

<p>The elder Philipson now rejoined his son, whom
he directed to hire horses, together with a guide,
to conduct them with all speed to the presence of
the Duke of Burgundy. By various inquiries in
the town, and especially among the soldiers of the
slain De Hagenbach, they at length learned that
Charles had been of late occupied in taking possession
of Lorraine, and, being now suspicious of
unfriendly dispositions on the part of the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
of Germany, as well as of Sigismund Duke of
Austria, had drawn a considerable part of his army
together near Strasburg, in order to be prepared
against any attempt of these princes, or of the
Free Imperial Cities, which might interfere with
his course of conquest. The Duke of Burgundy,
at this period, well deserved his peculiar epithet
of the Bold, since, surrounded by enemies, like
one of the nobler animals of the chase, he yet
astounded, by his stern and daring countenance,
not only the princes and states we have mentioned,
but even the King of France, equally powerful,
and far more politic, than himself.</p>

<p>To his camp, therefore, the English travellers
bent their way, each full of such deep and melancholy
reflection as, perhaps, prevented his bestowing
much attention on the other's state of mind.
They rode as men deeply immersed in their own
thoughts, and with less intercourse than had been
usual betwixt them on their former journeys.
The nobleness of the elder Philipson's nature, and
his respect for the Landamman's probity, joined
with gratitude for his hospitality, had prevented
him from separating his cause from that of the
Swiss deputies, nor did he now repent his generosity
in adhering to them. But when he recollected
the nature and importance of the personal
affairs which he himself had to despatch with a
proud, imperious, and irritable prince, he could
not but regret the circumstances which had involved
his own particular mission, of so much
consequence to himself and his friends, with that
of persons likely to be so highly obnoxious to the
Duke as Arnold Biederman and his companions;
and, however grateful for the hospitality of Geierstein,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
he regretted, nevertheless, the circumstances
which had obliged him to accept of it.</p>

<p>The thoughts of Arthur were no less anxious.
He found himself anew separated from the object
to which his thoughts were, almost against his
own will, constantly returning. And this second
separation had taken place after he had incurred
an additional load of gratitude, and found new as
well as more mysterious food for his ardent imagination.
How was he to reconcile the character
and attributes of Anne of Geierstein, whom he
had known so gentle, candid, pure, and simple,
with those of the daughter of a sage, and of an
elementary spirit, to whom night was as day, and
an impervious dungeon the same as the open portico
of a temple? Could they be identified as the
same being? or, while strictly alike in shape and
lineament, was the one a tenant of the earth, the
other only a phantom, permitted to show itself
among those of a nature in which she did not partake?
Above all, must he never see her more, or
receive from her own lips an explanation of the
mysteries which were so awfully entwined with
his recollections of her? Such were the questions
which occupied the mind of the younger traveller,
and prevented him from interrupting, or even
observing, the reverie in which his father was
plunged.</p>

<p>Had either of the travellers been disposed to
derive amusement from the country through which
their road lay, the vicinity of the Rhine was well
qualified to afford it. The ground on the left bank
of that noble river is indeed rather flat and tame;
and the mountains of Alsace, a ridge of which
sweeps along its course, do not approach so near as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
greatly to vary the level surface of the valley
which divides them from its shores. But the
broad stream itself, hurrying forward with dizzy
rapidity, and rushing around the islets by which
its course is interrupted, is one of the most
majestic spectacles in nature. The right bank is
dignified at once, and adorned, by the numerous
eminences covered with wood, and interspersed
with valleys, which constitute the district so well
known by the name of the Black Forest, to which
superstition attached so many terrors, and credulity
such a variety of legends. Terrors, indeed,
it had, of a real and existing character. The old
castles, seen from time to time on the banks of the
river itself, or on the ravines and large brooks
which flow into it, were then no picturesque ruins,
rendered interesting by the stories which were told
about their former inhabitants, but constituted the
real and apparently impregnable strongholds of
that Robber-chivalry whom we have already frequently
mentioned, and of whom, since Goethe,
an author born to arouse the slumbering fame of
his country, has dramatised the story of Goetz of
Berlichingen, we have had so many spirit-stirring
tales. The danger attending the vicinity of these
fortresses was only known on the right, or German
bank of the Rhine, for the breadth and depth of
that noble stream effectually prevented any foray
of their inhabitants from reaching Alsace. The
former was in possession of the Cities or Free
Towns of the Empire, and thus the feudal tyranny
of the German lords was chiefly exerted at the
expense of their own countrymen, who, irritated
and exhausted with their rapine and oppression,
were compelled to erect barriers against it, of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
nature as interesting and extraordinary as were
the wrongs from which they endeavoured to protect
themselves.</p>

<p>But the left bank of the river, over great part of
which Charles of Burgundy exercised his authority,
under various characters, was under the
regular protection of the ordinary magistrates, who
were supported in the discharge of their duty by
large bands of mercenary soldiers. These were
maintained by Charles out of his private revenue;
he, as well as his rival Louis, and other princes of
the period, having discovered that the feudal system
gave an inconvenient degree of independence
to their vassals, and thinking, of course, that it
was better to substitute in its place a standing
army, consisting of Free Companies, or soldiers by
profession. Italy furnished most of these bands,
which composed the strength of Charles's army,
at least the part of it in which he most trusted.</p>

<p>Our travellers, therefore, pursued their way by
the banks of the river, in as great a degree of security
as could well be enjoyed in that violent and
distracted time, until at length the father, after
having eyed for some time the person whom Arthur
had hired to be their guide, suddenly asked of his
son who or what the man was. Arthur replied
that he had been too eager to get a person who
knew the road, and was willing to show it, to be
very particular in inquiring into his station or
occupation; but that he thought, from the man's
appearance, he must be one of those itinerant
ecclesiastics, who travel through the country with
relics, pardons, and other religious trinkets, and
were in general but slightly respected, excepting
by the lower orders, on whom these vendors of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
superstitious wares were often accused of practising
gross deceptions.</p>

<p>The man's appearance was rather that of a
lay devotee, or palmer, bound on his pilgrimage
to different shrines, than of a mendicant friar,
or questionary. He wore the hat, scrip, staff,
and coarse dalmatic, somewhat like the military
cloak of the modern hussar, which were used by
such persons on their religious peregrinations. St.
Peter's keys, rudely shaped out of some scarlet rag
of cloth, appeared on the back of his mantle,
placed, as heralds say, saltire wise. This devotee
seemed a man of fifty and upwards, well-made,
and stout for his age, with a cast of countenance
which, though not positively ugly, was far from
being well-favoured. There was shrewdness, and
an alert expression in his eye and actions, which
made some occasional contrast with the sanctimonious
demeanour of the character he now bore.
This difference betwixt his dress and physiognomy
was by no means uncommon among persons of his
description, many of whom embraced this mode of
life, rather to indulge roving and idle habits, than
from any religious call.</p>

<p>"Who art thou, good fellow?" said the elder
Philipson; "and by what name am I to call thee
while we are fellow-travellers?"</p>

<p>"Bartholomew, sir," said the man; "Brother
Bartholomew&mdash;I might say Bartholomæus, but it
does not become a poor lay brother like me to
aspire to the honour of a learned termination."</p>

<p>"And whither does thy journey tend, good
Brother Bartholomew?"</p>

<p>"In whichever direction your worship chooses
to travel, and to require my services as guide,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
answered the palmer; "always premising, you
allow me leisure for my devotions at such holy
stations as we pass on our route."</p>

<p>"That is, thine own journey hath no professed
or pressing object or end?" said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"None, as your worship says, peculiar," said
the itinerant; "or I might rather say, that my
journey, good sir, embraces so many objects, that
it is matter of indifference to me which of them I
accomplish first. My vow binds me for four years
to travel from one shrine, or holy place, to another;
but I am not directly tied to visit them by any
precise rule of rotation."</p>

<p>"That is to say, thy vow of pilgrimage does not
prevent thee from hiring thyself to wait upon
travellers as their guide," replied Philipson.</p>

<p>"If I can unite the devotion I owe to the blessed
saints whose shrines I visit, with a service rendered
to a wandering fellow-creature who desires
to be directed upon his journey, I do maintain,"
replied Bartholomew, "that the objects are easily
to be reconciled to each other."</p>

<p>"Especially as a little worldly profit may tend
to cement the two duties together, if otherwise
incompatible," said Philipson.</p>

<p>"It pleases your honour to say so," replied the
pilgrim; "but you yourself may, if you will,
derive from my good company something more
than the mere knowledge of the road in which you
propose to travel. I can make your journey more
edifying by legends of the blessed saints whose
holy relics I have visited, and pleasing, by the
story of the wonderful things which I have seen
and heard in my travels. I can impart to you an
opportunity of providing yourself with his Holiness's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
pardon, not only for the sins which you
have committed, but also granting you indulgence
for future errors."</p>

<p>"These things are highly available doubtless,"
replied the merchant; "but, good Bartholomew,
when I desire to speak of them, I apply to my
father confessor, to whom I have been uniformly
regular in committing the charge of my conscience,
and who must be, therefore, well acquainted with
my state of mind, and best accustomed to prescribe
what its case may require."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Bartholomew, "I trust your
worship is too religious a man, and too sound a
Catholic, to pass any hallowed station without
endeavouring to obtain some share of the benefits
which it is the means of dispensing to those who
are ready and willing to deserve them. More
especially as all men, of whatever trade and degree,
hold respect to the holy saint who patroniseth his
own mystery; so I hope you, being a merchant,
will not pass the Chapel of Our Lady of the Ferry,
without making some fitting orison."</p>

<p>"Friend Bartholomew," said Philipson, "I have
not heard of the shrine which you recommend to
me; and, as my business is pressing, it were better
worth my while to make a pilgrimage hither on
purpose to make mine homage at a fitter season,
than to delay my journey at present. This, God
willing, I will not fail to do, so that I may
be held excused for delaying my reverence till
I can pay it more respectfully, and at greater
leisure."</p>

<p>"May it please you not to be wroth," said the
guide, "if I say that your behaviour in this matter
is like that of a fool, who, finding a treasure by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the road-side, omits to put it in his bosom and
carry it along with him, proposing to return from
a distance on a future day, of express purpose to
fetch it."</p>

<p>Philipson, something astonished at the man's
pertinacity, was about to answer hastily and
angrily, but was prevented by the arrival of three
strangers, who rode hastily up from behind them.</p>

<p>The foremost of these was a young female, most
elegantly attired, and mounted upon a Spanish
jennet, which she reined with singular grace and
dexterity. She wore on her right hand such a
glove as that which was used to carry hawks, and
had a merlin perched upon it. Her head was
covered with a montero cap, and, as was frequently
the custom at the period, she wore on her face a
kind of black silk vizard, which effectually concealed
her features. Notwithstanding this disguise,
Arthur Philipson's heart sprang high at the
appearance of these strangers, for he was at once
certain he recognised the matchless form of the
Swiss maiden by whom his mind was so anxiously
occupied. Her attendants were a falconer with
his hunting-pole, and a female, both apparently
her domestics. The elder Philipson, who had no
such accuracy of recollection as his son manifested
upon the occasion, saw in the fair stranger only
some dame or damsel of eminence engaged in the
amusement of hawking, and, in return to a brief
salutation, merely asked her, with suitable courtesy,
as the case demanded, whether she had spent
the morning in good sport.</p>

<p>"Indifferent, good friend," said the lady. "I
dare not fly my hawk so near the broad river, lest
he should soar to the other side, and so I might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
lose my companion. But I reckon on finding
better game when I have crossed to the other side
of the ferry, which we are now approaching."</p>

<p>"Then your ladyship," said Bartholomew, "will
hear mass in Hans' Chapel, and pray for your
success?"</p>

<p>"I were a heathen to pass the holy place without
doing so," replied the damsel.</p>

<p>"That, noble damsel, touches the point we were
but now talking of," said the guide Bartholomew;
"for know, fair mistress, that I cannot persuade
this worthy gentleman how deeply the success of
his enterprise is dependent upon his obtaining the
blessing of Our Lady of the Ferry."</p>

<p>"The good man," said the young maiden, seriously,
and even severely, "must know little of
the Rhine. I will explain to the gentleman the
propriety of following your advice."</p>

<p>She then rode close to young Philipson, and
spoke in Swiss, for she had hitherto used the German
language, "Do not start, but hear me!" and
the voice was that of Anne of Geierstein. "Do
not, I say, be surprised&mdash;or at least show not your
wonder&mdash;you are beset by dangers. On this road,
especially, your business is known&mdash;your lives
are laid in wait for. Cross over the river at
the Ferry of the Chapel, or Hans' Ferry, as it is
usually termed."</p>

<p>Here the guide drew so near to them that it
was impossible for her to continue the conversation
without being overheard. At that same moment
a woodcock sprang from some bushes, and the
young lady threw off her merlin in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Sa ho&mdash;sa ho&mdash;wo ha!" hollowed the falconer,
in a note which made the thicket ring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
again; and away he rode in pursuit. The elder
Philipson and the guide himself followed the
chase eagerly with their eyes, so attractive was the
love of that brave sport to men of all ranks. But
the voice of the maiden was a lure, which would
have summoned Arthur's attention from matters
more deeply interesting.</p>

<p>"Cross the Rhine," she again repeated, "at the
Ferry to Kirch-hoff, on the other side of the river.
Take your lodgings at the Golden Fleece, where
you will find a guide to Strasburg. I must stay
here no longer."</p>

<p>So saying, the damsel raised herself in her
saddle, struck her horse lightly with the loose reins,
and the mettled animal, already impatient at her
delay, and the eager burst of its companions, flew
forward at such a pace, as if he had meant to
emulate the flight of the hawk, and of the prey
he pursued. The lady and her attendants soon
vanished from the sight of the travellers.</p>

<p>A deep silence for some time ensued, during
which Arthur studied how to communicate the
warning he had received, without awakening the
suspicions of their guide. But the old man broke
silence himself, saying to Bartholomew, "Put
your horse into more motion, I pray you, and ride
onward a few yards; I would have some private
conference with my son."</p>

<p>The guide obeyed, and, as if with the purpose
of showing a mind too profoundly occupied by
heavenly matters to admit a thought concerning
those of this transitory world, he thundered forth
a hymn in praise of St. Wendelin the Shepherd,
in a strain so discordant as startled every bird
from every bush by which they passed. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
was never a more unmelodious melody, whether
sacred or profane, than that under protection of
which the elder Philipson thus conferred with
his son.</p>

<p>"Arthur," he said, "I am much convinced that
this howling hypocritical vagrant has some plot
upon us; and I had well-nigh determined that
the best mode to baffle it would be to consult my
own opinion, and not his, as to our places of repose,
and the direction of our journey."</p>

<p>"Your judgment is correct, as usual," said his
son. "I am well convinced of yonder man's
treachery, from a whisper in which that maiden
informed me that we ought to take the road to
Strasburg, by the eastern side of the river, and for
that purpose cross over to a place called Kirch-hoff,
on the opposite bank."</p>

<p>"Do you advise this, Arthur?" replied his
father.</p>

<p>"I will pledge my life for the faith of this
young person," replied his son.</p>

<p>"What!" said his father, "because she sits her
palfrey fairly, and shows a faultless shape? Such
is the reasoning of a boy&mdash;and yet my own old
and cautious heart feels inclined to trust her.
If our secret is known in this land, there are
doubtless many who may be disposed to think they
have an interest in barring my access to the Duke
of Burgundy, even by the most violent means; and
well you know that I should on my side hold my
life equally cheap, could I discharge mine errand
at the price of laying it down. I tell thee,
Arthur, that my mind reproaches me for taking
hitherto over little care of insuring the discharge
of my commission, owing to the natural desire I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
had to keep thee in my company. There now lie
before us two ways, both perilous and uncertain,
by which we may reach the Duke's Court. We
may follow this guide, and take the chance of his
fidelity, or we may adopt the hint of yonder
damsel-errant, and cross over to the other side of
the Rhine, and again repass the river at Strasburg.
Both roads are perhaps equally perilous. I feel it
my duty to diminish the risk of the miscarriage of
my commission, by sending thee across to the
right bank, while I pursue my proposed course
upon the left. Thus, if one of us be intercepted,
the other may escape, and the important commission
which he bears may be duly executed."</p>

<p>"Alas, my father!" said Arthur, "how is it
possible for me to obey you, when by doing so I
must leave you alone, to incur so many dangers,
to struggle with so many difficulties, in which my
aid might be at least willing, though it could only
be weak? Whatever befall us in these delicate
and dangerous circumstances, let us at least meet
it in company."</p>

<p>"Arthur, my beloved son," said his father, "in
parting from thee I am splitting mine own heart
in twain; but the same duty which commands us
to expose our bodies to death, as peremptorily
orders us not to spare our most tender affections.
We must part."</p>

<p>"Oh, then," replied his son, eagerly, "let me
at least prevail in one point. Do thou, my father,
cross the Rhine, and let me prosecute the journey
by the route originally proposed."</p>

<p>"And why, I pray you," answered the merchant,
"should I go one of these roads in preference to
the other?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>"Because," said Arthur eagerly. "I would warrant
yonder maiden's faith with my life."</p>

<p>"Again, young man?" said his father. "And
wherefore so confident in that young maiden's
faith? Is it merely from the confidence which
youth reposes in that which is fair and pleasing,
or have you had further acquaintance with
her than the late brief conversation with her
admitted?"</p>

<p>"Can I give you an answer?" replied his son.
"We have been long absent from lands of knights
and ladies, and is it not natural that we should
give to those who remind us of the honoured ties
of chivalry and gentle blood, the instinctive credence
which we refuse to such a poor wretch as this
itinerant mountebank, who gains his existence by
cheating, with false relics and forged legends, the
poor peasants amongst whom he travels?"</p>

<p>"It is a vain imagination, Arthur," said his
father; "not unbefitting, indeed, an aspirant to
the honours of chivalry, who draws his ideas of
life and its occurrences from the romances of the
minstrels, but too visionary for a youth who has
seen, as thou hast, how the business of this world
is conducted. I tell thee, and thou wilt learn to
know I say truth, that around the homely board
of our host the Landamman were ranged truer
tongues, and more faithful hearts, than the <i>cour
plénière</i> of a monarch has to boast. Alas! the
manly spirit of ancient faith and honour has fled
even from the breast of kings and knights, where,
as John of France said, it ought to continue to
reside a constant inhabitant, if banished from all
the rest of the world."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may, dearest father," replied the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
younger Philipson, "I pray you to be persuaded
by me; and if we must part company, let it be by
your taking the right bank of the Rhine, since I
am persuaded it is the safest route."</p>

<p>"And if it be the safest," said his father, with
a voice of tender reproach, "is that a reason why
I should spare my own almost exhausted thread of
life, and expose thine, my dear son, which has but
begun its course?"</p>

<p>"Nay, father," answered the son with animation,
"in speaking thus you do not consider the
difference of our importance to the execution of
the purpose which you have so long entertained,
and which seems now so nigh being accomplished.
Think how imperfectly I might be able to discharge
it, without knowledge of the Duke's person,
or credentials to gain his confidence. I might
indeed repeat your words, but the circumstances
would be wanting to attract the necessary faith,
and of consequence, your scheme, for the success of
which you have lived, and now are willing to run
the risk of death, would miscarry along with me."</p>

<p>"You cannot shake my resolution," said the
elder Philipson, "or persuade me that my life is
of more importance than yours. You only remind
me that it is you, and not I, who ought to be the
bearer of this token to the Duke of Burgundy.
Should you be successful in reaching his court or
camp, your possession of these gems will be needful
to attach credit to your mission; a purpose for
which they would be less necessary to me, who
can refer to other circumstances under which I
might claim credence, if it should please Heaven
to leave me alone to acquit myself of this important
commission, which, may Our Lady, in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
mercy, forefend! Understand, therefore, that,
should an opportunity occur by which you can
make your way to the opposite side of the Rhine,
you are to direct your journey so as again to cross
to this bank at Strasburg, where you will inquire
for news of me at the Flying Stag, a hostelry in
that city, which you will easily discover. If you
hear no tidings of me at that place, you will
proceed to the Duke, and deliver to him this
important packet."</p>

<p>Here he put into his son's hand, with as much
privacy as possible, the case containing the diamond
necklace.</p>

<p>"What else your duty calls on you to do," continued
the elder Philipson, "you well know; only
I conjure you, let no vain inquiries after my fate
interfere with the great duty you have there to
discharge. In the meantime, prepare to bid me
a sudden farewell, with a heart as bold and confident
as when you went before me, and courageously
led the way amid the rocks and storms of
Switzerland. Heaven was above us then, as it is
over us now. Adieu, my beloved Arthur! Should
I wait till the moment of separation, there may be
but short time to speak the fatal word, and no eye
save thine own must see the tear which I now
wipe away."</p>

<p>The painful feeling which accompanied this
anticipation of their parting was so sincere on
Arthur's part, as well as that of his father, that
it did not at first occur to the former, as a source
of consolation, that it seemed likely he might be
placed under the guidance of the singular female,
the memory of whom haunted him. True it was,
that the beauty of Anne of Geierstein, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
the striking circumstances in which she had exhibited
herself, had on that very morning been the
principal occupation of his mind; but they were
now chased from it by the predominant recollection,
that he was about to be separated in a
moment of danger from a father so well deserving
of his highest esteem and his fondest affection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that father dashed from his eye the
tear which his devoted stoicism could not suppress,
and, as if afraid of softening his resolution
by indulging his parental fondness, he recalled
the pious Bartholomew, to demand of him how far
they were from the Chapel of the Ferry.</p>

<p>"Little more than a mile," was the reply; and
when the Englishman required further information
concerning the cause of its erection, he was informed,
that an old boatman and fisherman, named
Hans, had long dwelt at the place, who gained a
precarious livelihood by transporting travellers and
merchants from one bank of the river to the other.
The misfortune, however, of losing first one boat
and then a second, in the deep and mighty stream,
with the dread inspired in travellers by the repetition
of such accidents, began to render his profession
an uncertain one. Being a good Catholic,
the old man's distress took a devotional turn. He
began to look back on his former life, and consider
by what crimes he had deserved the misfortunes
which darkened the evening of his days. His
remorse was chiefly excited by the recollection
that he had, on one occasion, when the passage
was peculiarly stormy, refused to discharge his
duty as a ferryman, in order to transport to the
other shore a priest, who bore along with him an
image of the Virgin, destined for the village of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Kirch-hoff, on the opposite or right bank of the
Rhine. For this fault Hans submitted to severe
penance, as he was now disposed to consider as
culpable his doubt of the Virgin's power of protecting
herself, her priest, and the bark employed
in her service; besides which, the offering of a
large share of his worldly goods to the church of
Kirch-hoff expressed the truth of the old man's
repentance. Neither did he ever again permit
himself to interpose any delay in the journey of
men of holy Church; but all ranks of the clergy,
from the mitred prelate to the barefooted friar,
might at any time of day or night have commanded
the services of him and his boat.</p>

<p>While prosecuting so laudable a course of life,
it became at length the lot of Hans to find, on the
banks of the Rhine, a small image of the Virgin,
thrown by the waves, which appeared to him
exactly to resemble that which he had formerly
ungraciously refused to carry across, when under
charge of the sacristan of Kirch-hoff. He placed
it in the most conspicuous part of his hut, and
poured out his soul before it in devotion, anxiously
inquiring for some signal by which he might discover
whether he was to consider the arrival of
her holy image as a pledge that his offences were
forgiven. In the visions of the night, his prayers
were answered, and Our Lady, assuming the form
of the image, stood by his bedside, for the purpose
of telling him wherefore she had come hither.</p>

<p>"My trusty servant," she said, "men of Belial
have burned my dwelling at Kirch-hoff, spoiled
my chapel, and thrown the sacred image which
represents me into the swoln Rhine, which swept
me downward. Now, I have resolved to dwell no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
longer in the neighbourhood of the profane doers
of this deed, or of the cowardly vassals who dared
not prevent it. I am, therefore, compelled to
remove my habitation, and, in despite of the
opposing current, I determined to take the shore
on this side, being resolved to fix my abode with
thee, my faithful servant, that the land in which
thou dwellest may be blessed, as well as thou and
thy household."</p>

<p>As the vision spoke, she seemed to wring from
her tresses the water in which they had been
steeped, while her disordered dress and fatigued
appearance was that of one who has been buffeting
with the waves.</p>

<p>Next morning brought intelligence that, in one
of the numerous feuds of that fierce period, Kirch-hoff
had been sacked, the church destroyed, and
the church treasury plundered.</p>

<p>In consequence of the fisherman's vision being
thus remarkably confirmed, Hans entirely renounced
his profession; and, leaving it to younger
men to supply his place as ferryman, he converted
his hut into a rustic chapel, and he himself,
taking orders, attended upon the shrine as a hermit,
or daily chaplain. The figure was supposed
to work miracles, and the ferry became renowned
from its being under the protection of the Holy
Image of Our Lady, and her no less holy servant.</p>

<p>When Bartholomew had concluded his account
of the Ferry and its Chapel, the travellers had
arrived at the place itself.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Upon the Rhine, upon the Rhine they cluster,</p>
<p class="i1">The grapes of juice divine,</p>
<p>Which make the soldier's jovial courage muster;</p>
<p class="i1">O blessed be the Rhine!</p>

<p class="i16"><i>Drinking Song.</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>A cottage or two on the side of the river, beside
which were moored one or two fishing-boats,
showed the pious Hans had successors in his profession
as a boatman. The river, which at a point
a little lower was restrained by a chain of islets,
expanded more widely, and moved less rapidly,
than when it passed these cottages, affording to
the ferryman a smoother surface, and a less heavy
stream to contend with, although the current was
even there too strong to be borne up against, unless
the river was in a tranquil state.</p>

<p>On the opposite bank, but a good deal lower
than the hamlet which gave name to the ferry,
was seated on a small eminence, screened by trees
and bushes, the little town of Kirch-hoff. A skiff
departing from the left bank was, even on favourable
occasions, carried considerably to leeward ere
it could attain the opposite side of the deep and
full stream of the Rhine, so that its course was
oblique towards Kirch-hoff. On the other hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
a boat departing from Kirch-hoff must have great
advantage both of wind and oars, in order to land
its loading or crew at the Chapel of the Ferry, unless
it were under the miraculous influence which
carried the image of the Virgin in that direction.
The communication, therefore, from the east to the
west bank was only maintained by towing boats
up the stream, to such a height on the eastern
side that the leeway which they made during the
voyage across might correspond with the point at
which they desired to arrive, and enable them
to attain it with ease. Hence it naturally happened
that, the passage from Alsace into Suabia
being the most easy, the ferry was more used by
those who were desirous of entering Germany, than
by travellers who came in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>When the elder Philipson had by a glance
around him ascertained the situation of the ferry,
he said firmly to his son,&mdash;"Begone, my dear
Arthur, and do what I have commanded thee."</p>

<p>With a heart rent with filial anxiety, the young
man obeyed, and took his solitary course towards
the cottages, near which the barks were moored,
which were occasionally used for fishing, as well
as for the purposes of the ferry.</p>

<p>"Your son leaves us?" said Bartholomew to the
elder Philipson.</p>

<p>"He does for the present," said his father,
"as he has certain inquiries to make in yonder
hamlet."</p>

<p>"If they be," answered the guide, "any matters
connected with your honour's road, I laud the
Saints that I can better answer your inquiries
than those ignorant boors, who hardly understand
your language."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<p>"If we find that their information needs thy
commentary," said Philipson, "we will request it&mdash;meanwhile,
lead on to the chapel, where my
son will join us."</p>

<p>They moved towards the chapel, but with slow
steps, each turning his looks aside to the fishing-hamlet;
the guide as if striving to see whether
the younger traveller was returning towards them,
the father anxious to descry, on the broad bosom
of the Rhine, a sail unloosed, to waft his son
across to that which might be considered as the
safer side. But though the looks of both guide
and traveller were turned in the direction of the
river, their steps carried them towards the chapel,
to which the inhabitants, in memory of the founder,
had given the title of Hans-Kapelle.</p>

<p>A few trees scattered around gave an agreeable
and silvan air to the place; and the chapel, that
appeared on a rising ground at some distance from
the hamlet, was constructed in a style of pleasing
simplicity, which corresponded with the whole
scene. Its small size confirmed the tradition that
it had originally been merely the hut of a peasant;
and the cross of fir-trees, covered with bark, attested
the purpose to which it was now dedicated.
The chapel and all around it breathed peace and
solemn tranquillity, and the deep sound of the
mighty river seemed to impose silence on each
human voice which might presume to mingle with
its awful murmur.</p>

<p>When Philipson arrived in the vicinity, Bartholomew
took the advantage afforded by his silence
to thunder forth two stanzas to the praise of the
Lady of the Ferry, and her faithful worshipper
Hans, after which he broke forth into the rapturous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
exclamation,&mdash;"Come hither, ye who fear
wreck, here is your safe haven!&mdash;Come hither, ye
who die of thirst, here is a well of mercy open
to you!&mdash;Come, those who are weary and far-travelled,
this is your place of refreshment!"&mdash;And
more to the same purpose he might have said,
but Philipson sternly imposed silence on him.</p>

<p>"If thy devotion were altogether true," he said,
"it would be less clamorous; but it is well to do
what is good in itself, even if it is a hypocrite who
recommends it.&mdash;Let us enter this holy chapel,
and pray for a fortunate issue to our precarious
travels."</p>

<p>The pardoner caught up the last words.</p>

<p>"Sure was I," he said, "that your worship is too
well advised to pass this holy place without imploring
the protection and influence of Our Lady
of the Ferry. Tarry but a moment until I find
the priest who serves the altar, that he may say
a mass on your behalf."</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by the door of the chapel
suddenly opening, when an ecclesiastic appeared
on the threshold. Philipson instantly knew the
Priest of St. Paul's, whom he had seen that morning
at La Ferette. Bartholomew also knew him,
as it would seem; for his officious hypocritical
eloquence failed him in an instant, and he stood
before the priest with his arms folded on his
breast, like a man who waits for the sentence of
condemnation.</p>

<p>"Villain," said the ecclesiastic, regarding the
guide with a severe countenance, "dost thou lead
a stranger into the houses of the Holy Saints, that
thou mayst slay him, and possess thyself of his
spoils? But Heaven will no longer bear with thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
perfidy. Back, thou wretch, to meet thy brother
miscreants, who are hastening hitherward. Tell
them thy arts were unavailing, and that the innocent
stranger is under <span class="smcap">MY</span> protection&mdash;under
my protection, which those who presume to violate
will meet with the reward of Archibald de
Hagenbach!"</p>

<p>The guide stood quite motionless, while addressed
by the priest in a manner equally menacing
and authoritative; and no sooner did the latter
cease speaking, than, without offering a word either
in justification or reply, Bartholomew turned round,
and retreated at a hasty pace by the same road which
had conducted the traveller to the chapel.</p>

<p>"And do you, worthy Englishman," continued
the priest, "enter into this chapel, and perform
in safety those devotions, by means of which
yonder hypocrite designed to detain you until his
brethren in iniquity came up.&mdash;But first, wherefore
are you alone? I trust naught evil hath
befallen your young companion?"</p>

<p>"My son," said Philipson, "crosses the Rhine
at yonder ferry, as we had important business to
transact on the other side."</p>

<p>As he spoke thus, a light boat, about which two
or three peasants had been for some time busy,
was seen to push from the shore, and shoot into
the stream, to which it was partly compelled to
give way, until a sail stretched along the slender
yard, and supporting the bark against the current,
enabled her to stand obliquely across the river.</p>

<p>"Now, praise be to God!" said Philipson, who
was aware that the bark he looked upon must be
in the act of carrying his son beyond the reach of
the dangers by which he was himself surrounded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p>"Amen!" answered the priest, echoing the
pious ejaculation of the traveller. "Great reason
have you to return thanks to Heaven."</p>

<p>"Of that I am convinced," replied Philipson;
"but yet from you I hope to learn the special
cause of danger from which I have escaped?"</p>

<p>"This is neither time nor place for such an
investigation," answered the Priest of St. Paul's.
"It is enough to say, that yonder fellow, well
known for his hypocrisy and his crimes, was
present when the young Switzer, Sigismund, reclaimed
from the executioner the treasure of
which you were robbed by Hagenbach. Thus
Bartholomew's avarice was awakened. He undertook
to be your guide to Strasburg, with the
criminal intent of detaining you by the way
till a party came up, against whose numbers
resistance would have been in vain. But his
purpose has been anticipated.&mdash;And now, ere
giving vent to other worldly thoughts, whether
of hope or fear&mdash;to the chapel, sir, and join
in orisons to Him who hath been your aid,
and to those who have interceded with him in
your behalf."</p>

<p>Philipson entered the chapel with his guide,
and joined in returning thanks to Heaven, and the
tutelary power of the spot, for the escape which
had been vouchsafed to him.</p>

<p>When this duty had been performed, Philipson
intimated his purpose of resuming his journey, to
which the Black Priest replied, "That far from
delaying him in a place so dangerous, he would
himself accompany him for some part of the journey,
since he also was bound to the presence of
the Duke of Burgundy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>"You, my father!&mdash;you!" said the merchant,
with some astonishment.</p>

<p>"And wherefore surprised?" answered the
priest. "Is it so strange that one of my order
should visit a prince's court? Believe me, there
are but too many of them to be found there."</p>

<p>"I do not speak with reference to your order,"
answered Philipson, "but in regard of the part
which you have this day acted, in abetting the
execution of Archibald de Hagenbach. Know you
so little of the fiery Duke of Burgundy as to
imagine you can dally with his resentment with
more safety than you would pull the mane of a
sleeping lion?"</p>

<p>"I know his mood well," said the priest; "and
it is not to excuse but to defend the death of De
Hagenbach that I go to his presence. The Duke
may execute his serfs and bondsmen at his pleasure,
but there is a spell upon my life which is
proof to all his power. But let me retort the
question&mdash;You, Sir Englishman, knowing the
conditions of the Duke so well&mdash;you, so lately
the guest and travelling companion of the most
unwelcome visitors who could approach him&mdash;you,
implicated, in appearance at least, in the uproar
at La Ferette&mdash;what chance is there of your
escaping his vengeance? and wherefore will you
throw yourself wantonly within his power?"</p>

<p>"Worthy father," said the merchant, "let each
of us, without offence to the other, keep his own
secret. I have, indeed, no spell to secure me from
the Duke's resentment&mdash;I have limbs to suffer
torture and imprisonment, and property which
may be seized and confiscated. But I have had in
former days many dealings with the Duke; I may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
even say I have laid him under obligations, and
hope my interest with him may in consequence be
sufficient, not only to save me from the consequences
of this day's procedure, but be of some
avail to my friend the Landamman."</p>

<p>"But if you are in reality bound to the court of
Burgundy as a merchant," said the priest, "where
are the wares in which you traffic? Have you no
merchandise save that which you carry on your
person? I heard of a sumpter-horse with baggage.
Has yonder villain deprived you of it?"</p>

<p>This was a trying question to Philipson, who,
anxious about the separation from his son, had
given no direction whether the baggage should
remain with himself, or should be transported to
the other side of the Rhine. He was, therefore,
taken at advantage by the priest's inquiry, to
which he answered with some incoherence,&mdash;"I
believe my baggage is in the hamlet&mdash;that is,
unless my son has taken it across the Rhine with
him."</p>

<p>"That we will soon learn," answered the priest.</p>

<p>Here a novice appeared from the vestiary of the
chapel at his call, and received commands to
inquire at the hamlet whether Philipson's bales,
with the horse which transported them, had been
left there, or ferried over along with his son.</p>

<p>The novice, being absent a few minutes, presently
returned with the baggage-horse, which,
with its burden, Arthur, from regard to his father's
accommodation, had left on the western side of
the river. The priest looked on attentively, while
the elder Philipson, mounting his own horse, and
taking the rein of the other in his hand, bade the
Black Priest adieu in these words,&mdash;"And now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
father, farewell! I must pass on with my bales,
since there is little wisdom in travelling with
them after nightfall, else would I gladly suit my
pace, with your permission, so as to share the way
with you."</p>

<p>"If it is your obliging purpose to do so, as
indeed I was about to propose," said the priest,
"know I will be no stay to your journey. I have
here a good horse; and Melchior, who must otherwise
have gone on foot, may ride upon your sumpter-horse.
I the rather propose this course, as it
will be rash for you to travel by night. I can
conduct you to an hostelry about five miles off,
which we may reach with sufficient daylight,
and where you will be lodged safely for your
reckoning."</p>

<p>The English merchant hesitated a moment. He
had no fancy for any new companion on the road,
and although the countenance of the priest was
rather handsome, considering his years, yet the
expression was such as by no means invited confidence.
On the contrary, there was something
mysterious and gloomy which clouded his brow,
though it was a lofty one, and a similar expression
gleamed in his cold grey eye, and intimated severity
and even harshness of disposition. But
notwithstanding this repulsive circumstance, the
priest had lately rendered Philipson a considerable
service, by detecting the treachery of his hypocritical
guide, and the merchant was not a man to be
startled from his course by any imaginary prepossessions
against the looks or manners of any one,
or apprehensions of machinations against himself.
He only revolved in his mind the singularity
attending his destiny, which, while it was necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
for him to appear before the Duke of Burgundy
in the most conciliatory manner, seemed to
force upon him the adoption of companions who
must needs be obnoxious to that prince; and such,
he was too well aware, must be the case with the
Priest of St. Paul's. Having reflected for an
instant, he courteously accepted the offer of the
priest to guide him to some place of rest and entertainment,
which must be absolutely necessary for
his horse before he reached Strasburg, even if he
himself could have dispensed with it.</p>

<p>The party being thus arranged, the novice
brought forth the priest's steed, which he mounted
with grace and agility, and the neophyte, being
probably the same whom Arthur had represented
during his escape from La Ferette, took charge, at
his master's command, of the baggage-horse of
the Englishman; and crossing himself, with a
humble inclination of his head, as the priest
passed him, he fell into the rear, and seemed to
pass the time, like the false brother Bartholomew,
in telling his beads, with an earnestness which
had perhaps more of affected than of real piety.
The Black Priest of St. Paul's, to judge by the
glance which he cast upon his novice, seemed to
disdain the formality of the young man's devotion.
He rode upon a strong black horse, more
like a warrior's charger than the ambling palfrey
of a priest, and the manner in which he managed
him was entirely devoid of awkwardness and
timidity. His pride, whatever was its character,
was not certainly of a kind altogether professional,
but had its origin in other swelling thoughts which
arose in his mind, to mingle with and enhance
the self-consequence of a powerful ecclesiastic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p>As Philipson looked on his companion from
time to time, his scrutinising glance was returned
by a haughty smile, which seemed to say, "You
may gaze on my form and features, but you cannot
penetrate my mystery."</p>

<p>The looks of Philipson, which were never known
to sink before mortal man, seemed to retort, with
equal haughtiness, "Nor shall you, proud priest,
know that you are now in company with one
whose secret is far more important than thine own
can be."</p>

<p>At length the priest made some advance towards
conversation, by allusion to the footing upon
which, by a mutual understanding, they seemed
to have placed their intercourse.</p>

<p>"We travel then," he said, "like two powerful
enchanters, each conscious of his own high and
secret purpose; each in his own chariot of clouds,
and neither imparting to his companion the direction
or purpose of his journey."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, father," answered Philipson; "I
have neither asked your purpose, nor concealed my
own, so far as it concerns you. I repeat, I am
bound to the presence of the Duke of Burgundy,
and my object, like that of any other merchant, is
to dispose of my wares to advantage."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, it would seem so," said the Black
Priest, "from the extreme attention to your merchandise,
which you showed not above half an
hour since, when you knew not whether your
bales had crossed the river with your son, or were
remaining in your own charge. Are English merchants
usually so indifferent to the sources of their
traffic?"</p>

<p>"When their lives are in danger," said Philipson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
"they are sometimes negligent of their
fortune."</p>

<p>"It is well," replied the priest, and again
resumed his solitary musings; until another half-hour's
travelling brought them to a <i>dorf</i>, or village,
which the Black Priest informed Philipson
was that where he proposed to stop for the night.</p>

<p>"The novice," he said, "will show you the inn,
which is of good reputation, and where you may
lodge with safety. For me, I have to visit a penitent
in this village who desires my ghostly offices;&mdash;perhaps
I may see you again this evening, perhaps
not till the next morning;&mdash;at any rate,
adieu for the present."</p>

<p>So saying, the priest stopped his horse, while
the novice, coming close up to Philipson's side,
conducted him onward through the narrow street
of the village, whilst the windows exhibited here
and there a twinkling gleam, announcing that the
hour of darkness was arrived. Finally, he led the
Englishman through an archway into a sort of
courtyard, where there stood a car or two of a
particular shape, used occasionally by women when
they travel, and some other vehicles of the same
kind. Here the young man threw himself from
the sumpter-horse, and placing the rein in Philipson's
hand, disappeared in the increasing darkness,
after pointing to a large but dilapidated
building, along the front of which not a spark of
light was to be discovered from any of the narrow
and numerous windows, which were dimly visible
in the twilight.

<h2>AUTHOR'S NOTES.</h2>

<p class="center p2"><a href="#Page_300">Note I. p. 300.</a><a name="note1" id="note1"></a></p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that in the Middle Ages the
office of public executioner was esteemed highly honourable
all over Germany. It still is, in such parts of that country as
retain the old custom of execution by stroke of sword, very
far from being held discreditable to the extent to which we
carry our feelings on the subject, and which exposed the magistrates
of a Scotch town, I rather think no less a one than
Glasgow, to a good deal of ridicule when they advertised,
some few years ago, on occasion of the death of their hangman,
that "none but persons of respectable character" need
apply for the vacant situation. At this day in China, in
Persia, and probably in other Oriental kingdoms, the Chief
Executioner is one of the great officers of state, and is as proud
of the emblem of his fatal duty as any European Lord Chamberlain
of his Golden Key.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the strange trial and execution of the
Knight of Hagenbach are detailed minutely by M. de Barante,
from contemporary MS. documents; and the reader will be
gratified with a specimen of that writer's narrative. A translation
is also given for the benefit of many of my kind readers.</p>

<p>
"De toutes parts on était accourus par milliers pour assister au
procès de ce cruel gouverneur, tant la haine était grande contre lui.
De sa prison, il entendait retentir sur le pont le pas des chevaux, et
s'enquérait à son geôlier de ceux qui arrivaient: soit pour être ses
juges, soit pour être témoins de son supplice. Parfois le geôlier
répondait, 'Ce sont des étrangers; je ne les connais pas.' 'Ne sont-ce
pas,' disait le prisonnier, 'des gens assez mal vêtus, de haute
taille, de forte apparence, montés sur des chevaux aux courtes
oreilles?' et si le geôlier répondait: 'Oui.'&mdash;'Ah ce sont les
Suisses,' s'écriait Hagenbach; 'Mon Dieu, ayez pitié de moi!' et il
se rappelait toutes les insultes qu'il leur avait faites, toutes ses insolences
envers eux. Il pensait, mais trop tard, que c'était leur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
alliance avec la maison d'Autriche qui était cause de sa perte. Le
4 Mai, 1474, après avoir été mis à la question, il fut, à la diligence
d'Hermann d'Eptingen, gouverneur pour l'archiduc, amené devant
ses juges, sur la place publique de Brisach. Sa contenance était
ferme et d'un homme qui ne craint pas la mort. Henri Iselin de
Bâle porta la parole au nom d'Hermann d'Eptingen, agissant pour
le seigneur du pays. Il parla à peu près en ces termes: 'Pierre de
Hagenbach, chevalier, maître d'hôtel de Monseigneur le Duc de
Bourgogne, et son gouverneur dans le pays de Sératte et Haute
Alsace, aurait dû respecter les privilèges reservés par l'acte d'engagement;
mais il n'a pas moins frotté aux pieds les lois de Dieu et des
hommes, que les droits jurés et garantis au pays. Il a fait mettre
à mort sans jugement quatre honnêtes bourgeois de Sératte; il a
depouillé la ville de Brisach de sa juridiction, et y a établi juges et
consuls de son choix; il a rompu et dispersé les communautés de la
bourgeoisie et des métiers; il a levé des impôts par sa seule volonté;
il a, contre toutes les lois, logé chez les habitans des gens de guerre&mdash;Lombards,
Français, Picards, ou Flamands; et a favorisé leur
désordres et pillages. Il leur a même commandé d'égorger leurs
hôtes durant la nuit, et avait fait préparer, pour y embarquer les
femmes et les enfans, des bateaux qui devaient être submergés
dans le Rhin. Enfin, lors même qu'il rejetterait de telles cruautés
sur les ordres qu'il a reçus, comment pourrait il s'excuser d'avoir
fait violence et outrage à l'honneur de tant de filles et femmes, et
même de saintes religieuses?'</p>

<p>"D'autres accusations furent portées dans les interrogatoires; et
des témoins attestèrent les violences faites aux gens de Mulhausen
et aux marchands de Bâle.</p>

<p>"Pour suivre toutes les formes de la justice, on avait donné un
avocat à l'accusé. 'Messire Pierre de Hagenbach,' dit-il, 'ne reconnaît
d'autre juge et d'autre seigneur que Monseigneur le Duc de
Bourgogne, dont il avait commission, et recevait les commandemens.
Il n'avait nul droit de contrôler les ordres qu'il était chargé
d'exécuter; et son devoir était d'obéir. Ne sait-on pas quelle soumission
les gens de guerre doivent à leur seigneur et maître? Croit-on
que le landvogt de Monseigneur le Duc eût à lui remontrer et à
lui résister? Et monseigneur n'a-t-il pas ensuite, par sa présence,
confirmé et ratifié tout ce qui avait été fait en son nom? Si des
impôts ont été demandés, c'est qu'il avait besoin d'argent. Pour
les recueillir, il a bien fallu punir ceux qui se refusaient à payer.
C'est ce que Monseigneur le Duc, et même l'empereur, quand ils
sont venus, ont reconnu nécessaire. Le logement des gens de guerre
était aussi la suite des ordres du Duc. Quant à la juridiction de
Brisach; le landvogt pouvait-il souffrir cette résistance? Enfin, dans
une affaire si grave, où il y va de la vie, convient-il de produire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
comme un véritable grief, le dernier dont a parlé l'accusateur?
Parmi ceux qui écoutent, y en a-t-il un seul qui puisse se vanter de
ne pas avoir saisi les occasions de se divertir? N'est-il pas clair que
Messire de Hagenbach a seulement profité de la bonne volonté de
quelques femmes ou filles; ou, pour mettre les choses au pis, qu'il
n'a exercé d'autre contrainte envers elles qu'au moyen de son bon
argent?'</p>

<p>"Les juges siégèrent long temps sur leur tribunal. Douze
heures entières passèrent sans que l'affaire fût terminée. Le Sire
de Hagenbach, toujours ferme et calme, n'allégua d'autres défenses,
d'autres excuses, que celles qu'il avait donné déjà sous la torture&mdash;les
ordres et la volonté de son seigneur, qui était son seul juge, et
le seul qui pût lui demander compte.</p>

<p>"Enfin, à sept heures du soir, à la clarté des flambeaux, les juges,
après avoir déclaré qu'à eux appartenait le droit de prononcer sur
les crimes imputés au landvogt, le firent rappeler; et rendirent
leur sentence qui le condamna à mort. Il ne s'émeut pas davantage;
et demanda pour toute grace d'avoir seulement la tête tranchée.
Huit bourreaux des diverses villes se présentèrent pour
exécuter l'arrêt. Celui de Colmar, qui passait pour le plus adroit,
fut préféré. Avant de le conduire à l'échafaud, les seize chevaliers
qui faisaient partie des juges requirent que Messire de Hagenbach
fût dégradé de sa dignité de chevalier et de tous ses honneurs.
Pour lors s'avança Gaspard Hurter, héraut de l'empereur; et il dit:
'Pierre de Hagenbach, il me déplaît grandement que vous ayez si
mal employé votre vie mortelle: de sorte qu'il convient que vous
perdiez non-seulement la dignité et ordre de chevalerie, mais aussi
la vie. Votre devoir était de rendre la justice, de protéger la
veuve et l'orphelin; de respecter les femmes et les filles, d'honorer
les saints prêtres; de vous opposer à toute injuste violence; et, au
contraire, vous avez commis tout ce que vous deviez empêcher.
Ayant ainsi forfait au noble ordre de chevalerie, et aux sermens que
vous aviez jurés, les chevaliers ici présens m'ont enjoint de vous en
ôter les insignes. Ne les voyant pas sur vous en ce moment, je
vous proclame indigne chevalier de Saint George, au nom et à
l'honneur duquel on vous avait autrefois honoré de l'ordre de chevalerie.'
Puis s'avança Hermann d'Eptingen: 'Puis qu'on vient de
te dégrader de chevalerie, je te dépouille de ton collier, chaîne d'or,
anneau, poignard, éperon, gantelet.' Il les lui prit et lui en frappa
le visage, et ajouta: 'Chevaliers, et vous qui désirez le devenir,
j'espère que cette punition publique vous servira d'exemple, et que
vous vivrez dans la crainte de Dieu, noblement et vaillamment,
selon la dignité de la chevalerie et l'honneur de votre nom.' Enfin,
le prévôt d'Einsilheim et maréchal de cette commission de juges se
leva, et s'adressant au bourreau, lui dit: 'Faites selon la justice.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>

<p>"Tous les juges montèrent à cheval ainsi qu'Hermann d'Eptingen.
Au milieu d'eux marchait Pierre de Hagenbach, entre
deux prêtres. C'était pendant la nuit. Des torches éclairaient la
marche; une foule immense se pressait autour de ce triste cortège.
Le condamné s'entretenait avec son confesseur d'un air pieux et
recueilli, mais ferme; se recommandant aussi aux prières de tous
ceux qui l'entouraient. Arrivé dans une prairie devant la porte de
la ville, il monta sur l'échafaud d'un pas assuré; puis élevant la
voix:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Je n'ai pas peur de la mort,' dit-il; 'encore que je ne l'attendisse
pas de cette sorte, mais bien les armes à la main; que je plains
c'est tout le sang que le mien fera couler. Monseigneur ne laissera
point ce jour sans vengeance pour moi. Je ne regrette ni ma vie,
ni mon corps. J'étais homme&mdash;priez pour moi.' Il s'entretint
encore un instant avec son confesseur, présenta la tête et reçut le
coup."&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. de Barante</span>, tom. x. p. 197.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Translation.</span></p>

<p>"Such was the detestation in which this cruel governor was
held, that multitudes flocked in from all quarters to be present at
his trial. He heard from his prison the bridge re-echo with the
tread of horses, and would ask of his jailer respecting those who
were arriving, whether they might be his judges, or those desirous
of witnessing his punishment. Sometimes the jailer would answer,
'These are strangers whom I know not.'&mdash;'Are not they,' said the
prisoner, 'men meanly clad, tall in stature, and of bold mien,
mounted on short-eared horses?' And if the jailer answered in
the affirmative, 'Ah, these are the Swiss,' cried Hagenbach. 'My
God, have mercy on me!' and he recalled to mind all the insults
and cruelties he had heaped upon them. He considered, but too
late, that their alliance with the house of Austria had been his
destruction.</p>

<p>"On the 4th of May, 1474, after being put to the torture, he was
brought before his judges in the public square of Brisach, at the
instance of Hermann d'Eptingen, who governed for the Archduke.
His countenance was firm, as one who fears not death. Henry
Iselin of Bâle first spoke in the name of Hermann d'Eptingen, who
acted for the lord of the country. He proceeded in nearly these
terms:&mdash;'Peter de Hagenbach, knight, steward of my lord the
Duke of Burgundy, and his governor in the country of Seratte and
Haute Alsace, was bound to observe the privileges reserved by act
of compact, but he has alike trampled under foot the laws of God
and man, and the rights which have been guaranteed by oath to
the country. He has caused four worshipful burgesses of Seratte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
to be put to death without trial; he has spoiled the city of Brisach,
and established there judges and consuls chosen by himself; he
has broken and dispersed the various communities of burghers and
craftsmen; he has levied imposts of his own will; contrary to
every law, he has quartered upon the inhabitants soldiers of various
countries, Lombards, French, men of Picardy and Flemings, and
has encouraged them in pillage and disorder; he has even commanded
these men to butcher their hosts during night, and had
caused boats to be prepared to embark therein women and children
to be sunk in the Rhine. Finally, should he plead the orders which
he had received as an excuse for these cruelties, how can he clear
himself of having dishonoured so many women and maidens, even
those under religious vows?'</p>

<p>"Other accusations were brought against him by examination,
and witnesses proved outrages committed on the people of Mulhausen,
and the merchants of Bâle.</p>

<p>"That every form of justice might be observed, an advocate
was appointed to defend the accused. 'Messire Peter de Hagenbach,'
said he, 'recognises no other judge or master than my lord
the Duke of Burgundy, whose commission he bore and whose
orders he received. He had no control over the orders he was
charged to execute;&mdash;his duty was to obey. Who is ignorant of
the submission due by military retainers to their lord and master?
Can any one believe that the landvogt of my lord the Duke could
remonstrate with or resist him? And has not my lord confirmed
and ratified by his presence all acts done in his name? If imposts
have been levied, it was because he had need of money; to obtain
it, it was necessary to punish those who refused payment: this
proceeding my lord the Duke, and the Emperor himself, when present,
have considered as expedient. The quartering of soldiers
was also in accordance with the orders of the Duke. With respect
to the jurisdiction of Brisach, could the landvogt permit any resistance
from that quarter? To conclude, in so serious an affair,&mdash;one
which touches the life of the prisoner,&mdash;can the last accusation
be really considered a grievance? Among all those who hear
me, is there one man who can say he has never committed similar
imprudences? Is it not evident that Messire de Hagenbach has
only taken advantage of the good-will of some girls and women, or,
at the worst, that his money was the only restraint imposed upon
them?'</p>

<p>"The judges sat for a long time on the tribunal. Twelve hours
elapsed before the termination of the trial. The Knight of Hagenbach,
always calm and undaunted, brought forward no other defence
or excuse than what he had before given when under the torture;
viz. the orders and will of his lord, who alone was his judge, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
who alone could demand an explanation. At length, at seven in
the evening, and by the light of torches, the judges, after having
declared it their province to pronounce judgment on the crimes of
which the landvogt was accused, caused him to be called before them,
and delivered their sentence condemning him to death. He betrayed
no emotion, and only demanded as a favour, that he should be
beheaded. Eight executioners of various towns presented themselves
to execute the sentence; the one belonging to Colmar, who
was accounted the most expert, was preferred.</p>

<p>"Before conducting him to the scaffold, the sixteen knights,
who acted as judges, required that Messire de Hagenbach should
be degraded from the dignity of knight, and from all his honours.
Then advanced Gaspar Hurter, herald of the Emperor, and said:&mdash;'Peter
de Hagenbach, I deeply deplore that you have so employed
your mortal life, that you must lose not only the dignity and
honour of knighthood, but your life also. Your duty was to render
justice, to protect the widow and orphan, to respect women and
maidens, to honour the holy priests, to oppose every unjust outrage:
but you have yourself committed what you ought to have
opposed in others. Having broken, therefore, the oaths which you
have sworn, and having forfeited the noble order of knighthood,
the knights here present have enjoined me to deprive you of its
insignia. Not perceiving them on your person at this moment, I
proclaim you unworthy Knight of St. George, in whose name and
honour you were formerly admitted in the order of knighthood.'
Then Hermann d'Eptingen advanced. 'Since you are degraded
from knighthood, I deprive you of your collar, gold chain, ring,
poniard, spur, and gauntlet.' He then took them from him, and,
striking him on the face, added:&mdash;'Knights, and you who aspire
to that honour, I trust this public punishment will serve as an
example to you, and that you will live in the fear of God, nobly
and valiantly, in accordance with the dignity of knighthood, and
the honour of your name.' At last the provost of Einselheim, and
marshal of that commission of judges, arose, and addressing himself
to the executioner,&mdash;'Let justice be done.'</p>

<p>"All the judges, along with Hermann d'Eptingen, mounted on
horseback; in the midst of them walked Peter de Hagenbach
between two priests. It was night, and they marched by the light
of torches; an immense crowd pressed around this sad procession.
The prisoner conversed with his confessor, with pious, collected,
and firm demeanour, recommending himself to the prayers of the
spectators. On arriving at a meadow without the gate of the town,
he mounted the scaffold with a firm step, and elevating his voice,
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I fear not death, I have always expected it; not, indeed, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
this manner, but with arms in my hand. I regret alone the blood
which mine will cause to be shed; my lord will not permit this
day to pass unavenged. I regret neither my life nor body. I was a
man&mdash;pray for me!' He conversed an instant more with his
confessor, presented his head, and received the blow."&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. de

<h2>EDITOR'S NOTES.</h2>

<p>(<a name="ednote_a" id="ednote_a" href="#enanchor_a"><i>a</i></a>) p. 3. Laupen and Sempach. The former battle was
fought in 1339, and resulted in a triumph of the city of
Berne over the neighbouring <i>noblesse</i>. Sempach (July 9, 1386)
was the famous victory of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and
Lucerne over a much larger force of Austrian chivalry.
Leopold III. and Arnold von Winkelried fell in this action.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_b" id="ednote_b" href="#enanchor_b"><i>b</i></a>) p. 6. "A large body of whom had long since invaded
the Forest Cantons." This foray was called the English, or
Gugler, war (1374-75). Enguerrand (Ingelram) de Coucy,
husband of Isabella, daughter of Edward III., was endeavouring
to gain some towns in the Aargau, which he claimed
through his mother, Catherine, daughter of Leopold III., who
fell at Sempach in 1386. Many Englishmen served under
Enguerrand: they were routed in the Entlibuch, in 1375, by
the men of Lucerne, Schwyz, Berne, and Unterwalden.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_c" id="ednote_c" href="#enanchor_c"><i>c</i></a>) p. 65. "The war of Zurich." Civil war, mainly
arising from the conquests and ambitions of the Cantons,
broke out in 1436, and, with intervals, lasted till 1450.
Zurich renounced the Hapsburg alliance, and most of her lost
lands were restored by her opponents, the Confederates.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_d" id="ednote_d" href="#enanchor_d"><i>d</i></a>) p. 86. "The Chapel of St. Jacob." Zurich was
defeated at St. Jacob, on the Sihl, in 1443. There was also a
battle near the Leper hospital of St. Jacob on the Birs, on
August 26, 1444.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_e" id="ednote_e" href="#enanchor_e"><i>e</i></a>) p. 100. "<i>Usum non habeo.</i>" The reference, of course,
is to David's refusal of armour before his duel with Goliath.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_f" id="ednote_f" href="#enanchor_f"><i>f</i></a>) p. 113. "The Duke of Burgundy's possessions in
Alsatian territory." A history of these complex matters cannot
be written in a note to a romance. The reader who is
anxious for information may consult Mr. Kirk's "Charles the
Bold," vol. ii. book iv. ch. iv. (London, 1863). Mr. Kirk
supplies an interesting defence of Hagenbach, and does not
believe in a spontaneous popular insurrection, caused by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
tyranny. The intrigues of Louis XI. receive the credit, or
discredit, of the whole affair, which culminated in the ruin of
Burgundy. The Swiss declared war "simply as the strong,
intelligent, hired bravoes of a foreign potentate, too weak, too
timid, or too crafty to strike with his own hand."</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_g" id="ednote_g" href="#enanchor_g"><i>g</i></a>) p. 214. "Double gangers." This is the appearance
described and criticised by Mr. Kirk in his "Secret Commonwealth"
(1691) as "The Co-Walker." The learned author
explains that we have all our spiritual shadows in the "Secret
Commonwealth": it is these which are sometimes seen when
the real human being is not present. The end of the "Co-Walker"
is that he "goes to his own herd." Goethe is said
to have seen his own co-walker, and the same experience
occurred to a living person of the Editor's acquaintance, in
the open air, where no mirror could account for the hallucination.
Even the sceptical Lucretius admits the existence of
such apparitions, which he explains by what Kirk calls
"exuvious fumes." The passage is not very intelligible,
because the author's ideas were not very distinct.</p>

<p>(<a name="ednote_h" id="ednote_h" href="#enanchor_h"><i>h</i></a>) p. 299. "A tall man, attired in red." The headsman
was, in fact, "a short man with a short sword," the executioner
of Colmar (Kirk, "Charles the Bold," ii. 240).
Hagenbach was racked four times before his death. "Schilling
confesses that a general sympathy was excited by Hagenbach's
Christian-like demeanour." His real name was Peter.
Mr. Kirk endeavours to "whitewash" Hagenbach. As that
unfortunate hero had "a gaunt countenance deeply caved
between the jaw-bones, and restless searching blood-shot eyes"
("Vitæ SS. Gervasii et Prothasii," 1506), we may presume
that his character was unamiable.</p>
